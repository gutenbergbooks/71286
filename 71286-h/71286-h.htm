PREFACE.
</p>

<p>
"In regard to prefaces," says the author of "Curiosities
of Literature,"&mdash;"ladies consider them so much space for a
love story lost, though the Italians call them <i>la salsa del
libra</i>,&mdash;the spice of the book."
</p>

<p>
Be this as it may, I must mention that many of the men
whose names occur in these pages, bore the part ascribed
to them during the operations of Sir Charles Grey's army
in the Antilles.
</p>

<p>
A duel, nearly similar to that which is described as having
taken place on board of the <i>Adder</i> frigate, actually occurred
on the deck of one of H.M.'s ships-of-war when lying in a
South-American port, in 1821.
</p>

<p>
The situation of the wreck in the Isle of Tortoises was
suggested to me by the discovery of a mysterious vessel in
a cavern of the island of Baccalieu, when I was at Fort
Townsend in Newfoundland, where it excited much speculation.
</p>

<p>
As a few Mexican dollars were found on the rocks near,
she was supposed to be Spanish; and such rumours were
circulated of the vast treasure she contained, that
H.M.S. <i>Comus</i> was despatched from Halifax to investigate the
matter; but the hull contained a few dead bodies alone.
</p>

<p>
That the marvellous might not be wanting, there was
told a story of a gigantic anchor being thrown by the sea
on the desert shore near her.  There it lay for a time, till a
party came to remove it; but it had vanished, like the
treasure,&mdash;by no mortal agency, of course!

<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br><br>
BOYHOOD.
</h3>

<p>
"When is a man the arbiter of his own destiny? for
he is like the leaf which is torn from a tree, and which the
wind of heaven blows about."
</p>

<p>
This fate has been my own, as peculiarly as it has been
that of other military wanderers in life; for your soldier is
a great traveller both by sea and land, an errant and a
restless spirit; yet his travels and his restlessness are
involuntary; for the moment he dons the red coat he
ceases to be the master of "his own proper person," or (like
the leaf torn from the tree) to be the arbiter of his own
destiny; but must march, sail, or fight wheresoever he may
be ordered, <i>obedience</i> being the first word in his vocabulary.
He becomes a machine in some sort, yet <i>not</i> a machine
according to the degrading idea of his sapient majesty of
Prussia; for the history of mankind will prove that the
most brilliant achievements in war, and the most happy
results in peace, like those efforts by which thrones have
been won and nations freed, had their origin in the influence
of the human heart, and in the mastery of the human
passions, when hope, religion, or love of country, fired the
soldier's spirit!  Who, then, will dare to say that the poor
private soldier who mounts a deadly breach, or rushes on a
hedge of steel, risking mutilation, wounds, and death,
without the hope of future fame if he falls, or the chance of
sharing in the glory of the victory his valour wins if he
survive,&mdash;is the mere automaton, the cold in blood and
basely utilitarian would have him to be?
</p>

<p>
Love of country, a noble sentiment, is ever strong in the
heart of a true soldier.  When the 67th, or South
Hampshire regiment, commanded by Callender of Craigforth,
landed at Portsmouth in 1772, after a long career of
dangerous foreign service, with one accord and impulse the
whole of the men threw themselves on the beach and kissed
the pebbles.
</p>

<p>
The reader will pardon the professional vanity, or <i>esprit
de corps</i>, which makes me thus prelude the plain unvarnished
story of a soldier's career,&mdash;a description of some
of the adventures I have passed through, the persons I have
met, and the scenes I have witnessed on my march through
life.
</p>

<p>
I was born in the camp of Burgoyne's army when it was
on the borders of Lake Champlain: thus, the first sounds
to which my infant ears became accustomed were the rattle
of the drum, the notes of the Kentish bugle, the tread of
marching feet, and the thoughtless hilarity of my father's
comrades.
</p>

<p>
I remember myself first as a little boy, the pet and
plaything of the soldiers, who made bats and balls, tops and
toys for me; who allowed me to ride on their backs, and to
hold on by their queues, whenever I had a mind to do so;
who told me old stories of Wolfe's days, of the siege of
Belleisle, and of wild adventures in West Florida.  I
remember of marches from town to town, from camp to
barrack, and from fort to fort&mdash;all of which seem like dreams
to me now; while the troops trod on, through clouds of
summer dust or the deep snows of an American winter, and
I with other regimental imps, sat merrily and cosily perched
on the summit of a baggage-waggon, among trunks,
arm-chests, knapsacks, pots, kettles, and soldiers' wives, who
smoked, sung, and swore occasionally, and bantered the
escort who marched on each side, with bayonets fixed.  A
thousand childish incidents of the soldiers' kindness to me
when a boy (because they loved my father well), are
lingering in my memory, while many a more important event
of the days and years between that time and this, is
forgotten for ever.
</p>

<p>
My father was a captain in a Scottish regiment, which
formed a portion of Sir John Burgoyne's unfortunate army.
He had received a severe wound at the storming of a
stockaded fort near Skenesborough, and had to undergo the
delicate operation of trepanning, which was skilfully done
with a silver plate, whereon he had fancifully inscribed his
name and the number of the regiment.  He was afterwards
slain in a skirmish on the banks of the Hudson, and was
hastily buried on the field.  The <i>last</i> time I saw him, was
when my mother, with her eyes full of tears, held me up
in her arms that the poor man might kiss me, as he was
buckling on his sword, while the troops went hurriedly to
the front.  The livelong day the roar of the distant musketry
rung in the pale woman's ears and in her soul, as the din of
battle rose and fell upon the gusty wind.  At sunset the
troops came back defeated and dispirited; but my father
<i>not</i> among them.  He was lying at the foot of a pine-tree,
shot through the heart!
</p>

<p>
After this bereavement, my mother returned home with
her two children (my sister Lotty and myself), and, renting
a small cottage, about a mile from her native town, lived the
quiet and secluded life that the scanty pension of a captain's
widow allotted her.
</p>

<p>
I was two years older than dear little Lotty, who was a
pretty black-eyed girl, with a fair skin, and great masses of
dark-brown hair.
</p>

<p>
At our mother's side, as children, we prattled and talked
of the regiment.  It was the centre around which our
thoughts revolved; the feature upon which all our conversations
and infant recollections hinged, though its ranks were
filling fast with new faces, and the old had long since
forgotten us; yet it was always "the Regiment"&mdash;our once
happy, movable home&mdash;that we spoke of, as of some good
friend that loved us, and was far away; and I loved the coarse
red uniform, with its pewter buttons and white braid, for its
wearers seemed a race of men apart from the cold and selfish
society among which my mother's diminished means and
widowhood had cast her.  She, poor woman! seemed to feel
something of this, too; for more than once, on beholding a
wayfaring soldier passing through our quiet little village, I
have seen her start, with her eyes full of tears, as her
thoughts reverted to <i>him</i> who was sleeping far away in his
lonely grave by the shore of the mighty Hudson.  Like that
old Scottish lady who is so beautifully portrayed in the
"Lounger," "when she spoke of a soldier, it was in a style
above her usual simplicity; there was a sort of swell in her
language which sometimes a tear (for her age had not lost
the privilege of tears) made still more eloquent.  She kept
her sorrows, like the devotions that solaced them, sacred to
herself; they threw nothing of gloom over her deportment;
a gentle shade only, like the fleckered clouds of summer,
that increase, not diminish, the benignity of the season."
</p>

<p>
The pretty village in which we resided lay at the bottom
of a dell, which, in shape, resembled a great natural basin.
Its sloping sides were clothed with luxuriant wood.  Above
the ancient trees, the old grey belfry of the village
church&mdash;a church in which Knox had preached and the Covenant
was signed&mdash;peeped forth from a mass of ivy that clambered
to its weathercock.  Through the dell brawled a rapid
stream, which came foaming down from the mountains, and
turned the great mossy wheel of an ancient mill, which, with
the blue-slated manse, the quaint old kirk, and the ruined
fragment of a haunted tower, wherein, as legends averred,
a spectre wandered and treasure was buried, formed the
four principal features in the valley.
</p>

<p>
The stream where the spotted trout lurked in the deeper
holes, or shot to and fro in the sunbeams, was crossed by a
little bridge, which, in my boyhood, I considered a great
work of art, though, in after-years, I was astonished to find
it so diminutive.  The rush of the mill-race, as it poured in
white foam over a wooden duct; the voices of the children
that played on the green before the village school; the
ceaseless clink of the hammer in the forge, which formed the
rendezvous of all the male gossips; the occasional note of a
blackbird or a cushat dove from the coppice,&mdash;were the only
sounds that were heard in our valley, save when the tolling
of the church bell announced the Sunday, when the air was
hushed and still, "and even the forest leaves seemed stirred
with prayer."
</p>

<p>
Though little more than a mile from a large and populous
city, our hamlet was as secluded as if it had been twenty
leagues distant.  No thought had we then of railroads,
electric wires, or Atlantic cables; and even the stage-coach
passed far from our wooded locality.
</p>

<p>
Our cottage was neat and small: it was situated on a
slope of the dell which faced the south, and was buried
among the woodbine, clematis, and sweetbrier, which
covered all its rustic porch, grew around the windows, and
clambered over the chimney-tops.
</p>

<p>
I can yet, in memory, see the little parlour in which we
used to sit in the long nights of winter, by the cheerful fire,
above which hung my father's sword and old gilt gorget,
with two engravings of General Wolfe and the Marquis of
Cornwallis in full uniform, with white breeches and
kevenhuller hats; and where we spent the calm evenings of
summer, when the light lingered long in the blushing west,
and the perfume of the sweetbrier, the wild roses, the
ripening fields, and of the fragrant earth, on which the dew
was descending, were borne through the open windows;
while my mother&mdash;her grey hair smoothly banded under a
spotless white cap, her black dress and meek sweet face
making her look so like a picture, her work-basket and
knitting apparatus at hand&mdash;read to Lotty and me, or spoke
of scenes and adventures she had seen when far away from
our present quiet locality, as she had an excellent memory
for anecdotes and a refined literary taste.  Thus she
became our sole preceptress.
</p>

<p>
Save old Dr. Twaddel, the minister, and the village
doctor, we had no neighbours, and consequently few visitors.
</p>

<p>
My mother spoke seldom of our father; but we could
see by the current of her thoughts that they rarely ran on
aught else than his memory.  Hopes she had none, save
those that were centred on us.
</p>

<p>
So, for seven years, the blameless tenor of our even life
rolled on.
</p>

<p>
My mother's quiet gentleness and soft ladylike manner,
together with her kindness to the poor of the village, the
sick and dying, among whom she shared her widow's mite&mdash;the
mite that in heaven shall become a talent of price,&mdash;caused
her to be tenderly loved by all; and I repent me
now, even after the long lapse of many stirring years, that
in her latter days, the tears that rolled over her pale and
fast-furrowing cheeks were caused by my errors, and it may
be, my selfish and resentful pride.

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
<br><br>
THE MINISTER.
</h3>

<p>
Time sped the faster that it sped unmarked; and now I
had reached that most important and unpleasant period of
a boy's life, when the necessity for increased action arrives;
and a period it too generally proves to all the delusions,
the dreams, and the charms of childhood&mdash;I mean the time
when grave old gentlemen begin to question us categorically,
and, as it often seems, somewhat intrusively, upon our future
plans, and to impress upon us the necessity of "doing
something for ourselves."
</p>

<p>
My mother, who had frequently spoken with me on this
subject, and seen with regret how my thoughts turned towards
the army, of which she had now a terror, as being the too
probable means of separating us for ever, resolved to
consult Dr. Twaddel, the minister, on the subject; and in
Scotland, "the minister" is always esteemed the second
person in the parish; so to this consultation I consented,
with some outward reluctance and considerable mental
repugnance.
</p>

<p>
Our minister was a good kind of man in his own quiet
way, though his excessive views of uprightness and propriety,
together with certain severe lectures he had read me
for making midnight raids into his orchard, for shooting one
of his hens with a penny cannon on the King's birthday (the
4th of June), and for burning "Johnnie Wilkes" in effigy
in the churchyard, had made him somewhat of a bugbear
to me.  He made indifferent sermons, but capital whisky
negus, and could take a comfortable share thereof, though
eschewing all hearty mirth or levity, and adopting in his
deportment that somewhat too solemn gravity and cold, hard
external rigidity, with which the mass of the Scottish
Lowlanders are tinged, and which makes their most sunny
summer Sunday a day of gloom and silence.  Like the
majority of the northern clergy, he was a humble, meek,
and well-meaning man, who, though he preached incessantly
against the nothingness of this world and the good things
thereof, had taken especial care to provide himself with a
remarkably well-dowered helpmate.  Without brilliance of
talent, he possessed just heart enough to find favour with
the poor of his flock; and head enough to accomplish his
Sunday task, by emitting a hazy sermon on some old scriptural
text, which no one cared a jot about.  Yet he was a
good man withal, our old parish minister.
</p>

<p>
I remember, on one occasion, while he was commencing
his sermon in the gloomy little village church, an old man
propping himself on a staff entered the aisle, and being a
stranger, he looked wearily and wistfully round for a seat.
Being clad in rather dilapidated garments, and having a
canvas wallet for alms, such as meal and broken bread, no
attention was paid to him, either by the pew-openers or the
congregation.  The old man tottered along the aisle, and
was about to seat himself humbly on the lower step of the
pulpit stair, when the portly minister, with a glance of
honest indignation on all around him, descended from the
pulpit, and taking the aged mendicant by the hand, led him
to his own pew, and placed him on a well-cushioned seat,
beside his wife and family, to the no small discomfiture of
the Misses Twaddel.
</p>

<p>
This silent rebuke was worth a thousand homilies; it
powerfully affected the whole congregation; and from that
moment, the minister, though usually cold and reserved,
completely won the esteem of my mother.  To consult him
on my affairs, we repaired to the manse, which was a
handsome and comfortable modern villa, separated from the
village church by an orchard and the humble burying-ground,
in which "the rude forefathers of the hamlet slept."  We were
speedily ushered into his presence in a snugly-curtained,
richly-carpeted, and fashionably-furnished room, which was
so large, that our little cottage might have stood within it
altogether.  He received us rather kindly than politely, as
he had a great esteem for my mother, though, since the advent
of the felonious appropriation of a dozen of golden pippins
and the slaughter of his best-laying hen, none whatever for
me; and while he reclined in an easy-chair and played with
a large bunch of gold seals in one hand, or polished his bald
head impatiently with the other, my mother, in a voice
that was rendered tremulous by her maternal love and
anxiety, briefly stated her wishes "concerning her boy
Oliver."
</p>

<p>
After letting her relate her own story unaided, he rather
sharply asked me what views I had for myself.
</p>

<p>
I glanced timidly at my mother; for although now nearly
sixteen, I felt like a child in her presence; and at that
moment, the influences of her faded cheek, her widow's cap,
with its modest crimping, and her sweet sad face, were not
lost upon me, though my proud spirit writhed under the
humiliation of consulting even such a parish potentate as the
minister, concerning me or my affairs.
</p>

<p>
"What views have you for yourself, sir?" reiterated the
minister.
</p>

<p>
"I wish to be&mdash;to be&mdash;&mdash;" I stammered and paused.
</p>

<p>
"What, sir&mdash;speak out!" continued the divine, authoritatively.
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, I wish to be a soldier."
</p>

<p>
"A soldier&mdash;whew!" he reiterated, with a tinge of
surprise and contempt in his tone.
</p>

<p>
"Like my father before me."
</p>

<p>
"And leave your poor mother alone in her old age, you
ungrateful loon! you should add that," he added, bending
his stern grey eyes angrily upon me.
</p>

<p>
I shrunk at these words, and was silent, for they found
an accusing echo in my heart.
</p>

<p>
"Could you endure his absence, Mrs. Ellis?"
</p>

<p>
"Alas!" said my poor mother, with her eyes full of tears,
"adversity has taught me to endure all things patiently&mdash;a
bitter art to cultivate; but such a separation would be the
hardest of all."
</p>

<p>
"Then we must put him to some respectable business,
where hard work and long hours will knock all silly notions
out of his head.  What kind of business would you like,
young man?"
</p>

<p>
"I do not know, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Then who should know, sir?  But no doubt you despise
all manner of business."
</p>

<p>
I was silent, and my mother gave me an imploring glance
to remain so.
</p>

<p>
"You are a boy&mdash;a mere bairn yet," resumed the minister,
in that contemptuous manner often adopted by testy old
gentlemen to their juniors; "but the trials of life will teach
you the hollowness of those romantic fancies which are
fostered by novels, playbooks, and such-like literary trash, of
which, I doubt not, you have devoured over many already.
You wish to be happy?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course, sir," said I, with a sigh of impatience; for all
this sounded uncomfortably like a lecture, or a scrap of the
doctor's sermons.
</p>

<p>
"Then you will find that it most truly consists in
bestowing happiness on others."
</p>

<p>
I pondered over this remark, for I was too young to
understand the application of it.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know the origin of happiness?" continued the
minister.
</p>

<p>
I could have said, Plenty of money and fun&mdash;a fine house,
a fine horse, and so forth; but I was silent, or merely said,
"No."
</p>

<p>
"Then hark you, Master Oliver Ellis&mdash;the origin of
happiness is contentment, and the resources of a mind humbled
by the trials with which it pleaseth God to inflict us."
</p>

<p>
"So I have heard you preach a thousand times," thought
I; and while I glanced around the magnificent drawing-room,
on his well-cushioned easy-chair, his amplitude of
paunch and successive folds of chin, the idea <i>did</i> occur to
me, that the apostles were content with fewer of this world's
goods; but I was silent again.
</p>

<p>
In short, the minister talked of morality and duty&mdash;of
business habits, of close application, and strict honesty, and
so forth, until I was heartily weary.  I seemed to listen, but
heard him not; for my thoughts were running far away on
other things, and had soared into the region of sunshine and
daydreams, until, after many trite common-places and
innumerable pious nothings, he broke the spell by bluntly
announcing that "the time was come when I <i>must</i> look
about me.  I was now sixteen; my mother was getting
old; she could not last for ever, and if anything happened
to her, what would become of <i>me</i>."
</p>

<p>
This cruel insinuation, so coldly uttered, cut me to the
heart, and my mother's sad eyes involuntarily sought mine.
She had often&mdash;too often in her sad and lonely hours&mdash;thought
of the separation death might one day make between
her penniless children and herself; but to hear it
thus roughly alluded to, was too much for her, and the poor
woman wept aloud.
</p>

<p>
The minister tried to console her by some hackneyed
scriptural text: that man was made to mourn,&mdash;that he
was sent into this world to be miserable, and had no business
to be anything else; but this burst of emotion on her part
stifled every secret aspiration and every strong wish in me,
and I assented to any plan his reverence had to propose,
resolving to leave to him the onerous office of opening up
the path that was to lead me to fortune and to fame.
</p>

<p>
He promised "to speak anent me to his <i>doer</i>," a literal,
and often fatally literal phrase, applied by the Scots to their
lawyer or "man of business," without consulting whom,
many of them will not even vote for an M.P., or do the
most trivial thing.  "I'll tak' a thought&mdash;I'll spier o' my
doer," being the answer in the country to almost everything
proposed.
</p>

<p>
Hence, in one week after our visit to the manse, I found
myself in Edinburgh, and perched on the leathern summit
of a high three-legged stool, in the office of Messrs. Harpy,
Quirky, and Macfarisee, solicitors, eminent alike for their
"sharp practice" and acute manner of handling all
troublesome or cloudy cases of insolvency.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap03"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br><br>
MESSRS. HARPY, QUIRKY, AND MACFARISEE.
</h3>

<p>
From the earliest period of which I can remember, I had
fixed upon pursuing the career of a soldier.  Notwithstanding
the grim specimens I had seen of it, during my
father's service in the States, I deemed it a life of glitter,
change, and jollity&mdash;a chain of pleasures&mdash;a long and
romantic panorama.  I saw only scarlet and feathers, gold
lace, the glitter of epaulettes and the flash of steel, with
music and sunshine; and from amid this chaos came forth
those airy castles and brilliant visions, which the mind of
every imaginative and impulsive boy can fashion so readily&mdash;and
too readily at times for his own peace; as such fragile
creations are but ill calculated to stand the rough shock of
awakening, or the stern realities of every-day life.
</p>

<p>
So it was with me.  My new occupation, with its
intolerable monotony, seemed a death-blow to all my hopes
and romantic fancies; while the manner and bearing of
Messrs. Harpy, Quirky, and Macfarisee, were in no way
calculated to reconcile me to my lot, or to enhance the
value of the dog's pittance they doled out me, and a few
other drudges of the quill.  If, after a trial, I liked (ugh!)
the law, I was to be indentured for five years, and to
commence my legal studies at the college&mdash;to dive deep
into "Stair's Institutes," "Dirlton's Doubts," and other
light literature of a similar kind: money was to be raised
to enable me pass muster; but my growing repugnance
to a civil life caused many delays in making the final
arrangements.
</p>

<p>
It was my misfortune to have to do with three of the
worst specimens of those legal and religious charlatans who
bring discredit on a profession which, for three hundred
years, has shed a brilliance over Scottish literature and
Scottish society.  If any such, now living, recognize themselves
in my delineation, the resemblance is entirely fortuitous, and
they had better not boast of it.
</p>

<p>
They had, I have said, a vast amount of "sharp practice,"
and law proved a dear commodity to those who dealt with
them.
</p>

<p>
The first partner was a wealthy idler, who gave himself
insufferable airs, and affected to be "a man about town;"
but then he brought business to the firm, and gave it an air
of respectability; the second was a legal bully, miserly and
underbred, longheaded and narrow-hearted; for Mr. Quirky
had been educated in one of the many charitable institutions
with which the city abounds, and had come forth into the
world a master in the science of subtlety, and without an
emotion of sympathy for anything human or divine.
</p>

<p>
Macfarisee was one of the most amusing of rogues.  With
the vanity of the first and the subtlety of the second, he
covered his many failings by a bland aspect of meek sanctity,
and that entire garb of accurate blackcloth which, with a
long visage and a white necktie, go far to impose upon the
simple in Scotland.
</p>

<p>
He was an elder, and reputed an upright pillar of the
Church, and on each successive Sunday might be seen, with
hands meekly folded, standing behind the brass platter
wherein the offerings of the charitable were dropped.  He
never hid his holy candle under a bushel, but subscribed only
to charities which published lists of the donors; he
outwardly and vehemently eschewed strong waters, laughter,
gaiety, the world, the flesh, and the devil; and yet, withal,
had privately the reputation of being on the best possible
terms with the latter.
</p>

<p>
He presided at all meetings for the conversion of Jews,
Sepoys, and Ojibbeways; he inveighed against Sunday
travelling, and the laxity of the present age; he
harangued most feelingly on the benefit that must accrue
from the moral, social, intellectual, and religious
improvement of Caffres and Hottentots; while his unfortunate
<i>employés</i> were reduced to the veriest of all white slavery, and,
toiling fourteen hours out of the four-and-twenty, wrote
their eyes blind and dim, during the dreary watches of
many a winter night, long after all were hushed in sleep,
and the nightly psalms and prayers, with which (in the way
of business) he edified the neighbourhood, were ended.  On
one hand he patronized Bible Societies, and gave flannels to
the poor; on the other, he had ungodly yearnings towards
the possessions of the rich, whom he spoiled, to use his
own phraseology, "even as the Egyptians were spoiled by
the Jews of old;" for, as a conveyancer of other people's
property into his own breeches pocket, Macfarisee had few
equals in Scotland.  He was one of a knot of small
provincial notorities, who hovered about the Lord Advocate
and the city M.P.'s, who got up public dinners and
testimonials for their own "glorification," for the purpose of
hearing themselves speak, and getting their otherwise very
obscure names into the local journals.
</p>

<p>
Harpy, our first partner, was suave and gentlemanly in
manner; thus, his chief occupation was to soothe, flatter,
or, as he phrased it, "to talk over" those clients whom his
compatriots had offended by insolence, or disgusted by
hypocrisy, and who threatened to transfer their business
and their papers elsewhere&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> to go out of the
frying-pan into the fire.
</p>

<p>
Behold me, then, commencing life on the summit of a
three-legged stool, in a dreary room, which overlooked a
gloomy back-court, abandoned to weeds and a few broken
bottles, and where nought living was seen, save an amatory
cat or so prowling along the wall.  I was intrenched among
green boxes and bundles of musty, dusty papers, which had
travelled to and fro for years, from the said dreary office to
the various courts of law, increasing in bulk and volume on
their travels, until each <i>process</i>&mdash;each fatal heir-loom&mdash;at
last smothered its proprietor, the fool or knave, who, bitten
by the <i>amor litigandi</i> of the modern Scots, and spurred on
by a faithless and dishonest "man of business," or lost in a
sea of duplicates and rejoinders&mdash;borrowing up of processes
and paying down fees; fighting before Lords Ordinary and
extraordinary&mdash;bewildered amid the difficulties, endless
repetitions and absurd amplifications, doubts, delays, and
expenses of the legal maelstrom into which Macfarisee had
lured him, found the "record closed," when his last shilling
had gone.
</p>

<p>
To me, the atmosphere in which I found myself was
stifling.  It was redolent of wax, red-tape, law-calf, and old
parchment; and there was around me an incessant jargon
about decrees and decisions, quirks, quibbles, statutes of
limitation, judgments by default, writs of error and
insolvency, acts of <i>cessio bonorum</i>, charges of caption and
horning, cases sent through outer and inner houses to
avizandum and the devil; and, save a hard-working
gentlemanly lad, who died a Lord of Council and Session, and,
than whom, no better ever sat upon the Scottish bench, my
compeers were selfish, vulgar, and obnoxious to me, as their
conversation consisted chiefly of pot-house wit, second-hand
jokes, and empty nothings.  Save alcohol, all spirit had
long since died out of them, and at the voice of Macfarisee,
they trembled as if under galvanism.  Nothing but my
repugnance for them, and daily irritation at the absurd
assumption of Harpy and the hypocrisy of Macfarisee,
prevented me from sinking into a state of mental atrophy,
though exceedingly mercurial in temperament and
itinerant in habit.
</p>

<p>
Hard work, however distasteful to a hero in embryo, I
could have endured with patience; but the bearing of the
three parvenus whom I served, and who were cold, thankless,
consequential as bashaws, and rude at times even to the
verge of brutality, soured my temper and maddened my fiery
spirit.
</p>

<p>
On the summit of that legal tripod, the three-legged stool
already referred to, I passed the greater portion of the year
1791.
</p>

<p>
There are times now when I think I viewed the poor
ephemeræ, whose drudge I deemed myself, through a false
medium; as I considered all who stood between me and
the army as the natural enemies of mankind; and, doubtless
too often, when I should have been drawing a deed or
engrossing an account, I was drawing a phantom sword,
engrossed in the pages of a novel, or following the merry
drums, the glittering accoutrements, and flaunting cockades
of a recruiting party.  In short, I believe the reader will
already perceive that it was not in human power to make a
lawyer out of such quicksilver material as Master Oliver
Ellis.
</p>

<p>
It was towards the close of the year already named, that
a change came over the monotonous tenor of my way; and,
like many other heroes who have flourished since the days
of Mark Antony, I must needs fall in love.  The way in
which this event&mdash;so important in such a narrative as
mine&mdash;came about was as follows.
</p>

<p>
One afternoon, when I was indulging in some of my
usual day dreams, after reading the gazette which detailed
the great treaty by which we prostrated the power of
the valiant Tippo Saib, I was roused by the harsh and
authoritative voice of Mr. Quirky, commanding me to accompany
him and Macfarisee on business a few miles from town,
To say <i>whither</i>, or what about, would have been too great a
condescension in men of their vast consequence; so I
snatched my hat gladly (anything active was a change from
the monotony of a desk at which I worked like a negro on
monkey's allowance), and, after receiving into my custody a
legal green bag, filled with papers, on a hackney-coach being
called, we drove out of town.
</p>

<p>
The month was October, and the woods wore the sombre
hues of autumn.  The wild rose still bloomed in the wayside
hedges; the house-martin, the redwing, and the swallow,
were still twittering about in search of the red berries, the
haw, the hip, the sloe, and the elder, which now furnished a
feast for them all.  We whirled on amid copsewood and
long lines of trees, that bordered or sheltered the bare fields,
and exhibited on their dropping leaves all shades of russet,
yellow, amber, dark-green, and red.  The time was evening,
and the dewy gossamer spread its silver web, laden with
dew, from tree to tree; and as those persons whom I
accompanied never deigned to address me, but conversed
together in whispers, I had nothing to draw my attention
from the objects visible on each side of the way, through
the hackney-coach glasses, after the dusk enabled me to lay
aside a canting tract, which Macfarisee had solemnly put
into my hand when we started, and which, in politeness
rather than hypocrisy, I had been pretending to peruse for
some time.
</p>

<p>
At last we turned into an avenue of fine sycamores,
through the waving branches of which the moonlight fell in
flaky gleams, and under which were two lines of the flowering
arbutus and monthly rose in full bloom.  The hoofs and
wheels scattered wide the rustling autumn leaves that lay
thick in the old avenue, and we speedily drew up on the
gravel that lay before the portico of a handsome mansion.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br><br>
APPLEWOOD.
</h3>

<p>
As the carriage drew up, the front door of the house was
opened by a servant in livery, and in the lighted hall
beyond there appeared a young girl, who, by her stature, by
her figure&mdash;which was light and graceful&mdash;and by the
unconfined masses of her flowing dark-brown hair, could not
have been more than seventeen&mdash;the age of all heroines
in the good old-fashioned times.
</p>

<p>
Messrs. Quirky and Macfarisee sprang out and ascended
the steps.
</p>

<p>
"I am so glad you have come at last," said the young
lady, in a tremulous voice of welcome.  "My aunt has
longed for you both so much, but more especially for you,
Mr. Macfarisee; she says that your prayers and pious
conversation achieve for her a greater ease of mind and body
than the ministrations of any clergyman or physician."
</p>

<p>
"My dear Miss Amy, I fear you flatter my partner,"
snarled Mr. Quirky; "but we hastened from town (though
hard pressed by a first-rate jury case) the moment we
received your letter, stating that she wished to settle her
worldly affairs."
</p>

<p>
"And how does the Lord deal with her?" asked
Macfarisee, in his most bland and dulcet manner.
</p>

<p>
"Severely, sir," replied the young girl whom he named
Amy, with her eyes full of tears; "you know she is always
believing herself to be dying, but she has been in great
suffering for three nights, and for these three nights and as
many days I have never left her bedside."
</p>

<p>
I now perceived that the girl's dark-blue eyes were
dimmed and bloodshot with tears and watching.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Amy," said Macfarisee, in the slow and impressive
tone, which he used to all but his clerks, to whom he spoke
sharply enough, "I feel happy&mdash;a holy happiness&mdash;that
illness has enlightened her mind, and that at last she has
resolved to take my advice."
</p>

<p>
"Sir&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I have so frequently recommended her to&mdash;to settle her
worldly affairs; but she weakly shunned all that reminded
her of mortality, ever replying that sufficient for the day
was the evil thereof; but, alas! my dear child," he
continued, in a sing-song voice, "lo you now, death cometh
like a thief in the night; but I trust he finds the Lord's
faithful servant duly prepared for the great change that is at
hand."
</p>

<p>
"Bravo, old six-and-eightpence!" thought I, as Quirky,
whom his partner's prosing wearied at times, snatched the
green bag from me impatiently, saying,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Here you, sir,&mdash;give me the documents.  Miss Amy,
your aunt's state of health has long been precarious; but
what says the doctor of her?"
</p>

<p>
"That&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What?"
</p>

<p>
"She cannot last long now; and she has been in misery,
waiting for you."
</p>

<p>
"The deuce! then we have no time to lose," said Macfarisee,
with one of his keen office glances at Quirky, through
a pair of eyes which were always "half-closed, like those of
a night-bird in the daytime."
</p>

<p>
"My dear, dear aunt!" sobbed the poor young girl;
"follow me to her room, if you please, and this young
gentleman&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he is only one of our young men, and may remain
here quite well."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Here</i>, in this cold lobby?  Oh, that would never do!
Walk into this room, sir; please to excuse us," said the
girl politely; and while my two employers, whom for their
pride and hypocrisy I consigned to very warm quarters
indeed, walked gingerly up stairs, I was left to my own
reflections in a dark parlour.
</p>

<p>
In this sudden trip to the country there was something
mysterious; and as I gazed through the window
upon the dark branches of the trees, tossing on the night-wind,
and pictured to myself the old woman dying up stairs,
strange and gloomy thoughts came over me; but on a
footman entering with candles, I asked him the name of the
house.
</p>

<p>
"Applewood," said he.
</p>

<p>
"The house of Mrs. Rose?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
Then a sudden light broke in upon me.  I remembered
that we had a wealthy client&mdash;an old widowed lady&mdash;whose
failing health, credulity, and ample funds, had long
rendered her a source of the deepest solicitude to
Messrs. Quirky and Macfarisee, whose passive victim she had to
every purpose and intent become; for she believed devoutly
in the worth, piety, and good works of our third partner.
In his double capacity of elder of his kirk and legal adviser,
Macfarisee had long been one of those who hovered by the
bedside of the dying, as vultures hover round a piece of
carrion, and this wealthy old lady, Mrs. Rose, of Applewood,
had long been marked by him as fair game to be run down
at last.
</p>

<p>
It was by a studied system of cant, and by an external
aspect of piety in its most fervid form, that Nathaniel
Macfarisee usually recommended himself to those whom he
deluded, and the number of legacies left to him by departed
friends was really somewhat surprising, though many of
them were averred to be for purposes of religion and
philanthropy; and when conversing with a bewildered client,
whom
</p>

<p class="poem">
  He darkened by elucidation,<br>
  And mystified by explanation.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
it was amusing to hear him interlarding all his remarks with
phrases and texts from scripture.
</p>

<p>
Amy Lee, the only living relation possessed by the old
proprietress of Applewood, was the orphan daughter of a
younger sister whom she never loved, for having married a
young officer whose attentions had been long and
provokingly divided between them.  Amy had been sent from
India to her care and kindness, penniless and otherwise
friendless, for her father and mother, with many friends and
relations, had perished in the dungeons of Tippo Saib.
</p>

<p>
The grudge which the old lady bore her sister in youth,
for depriving her of a first love, had taken some strange and
fantastic form of aversion in maturer years; and thus,
though the poor and lonely Amy attended her sick bed,
noting anxiously and sedulously all her querulous fancies,
seeking to soothe her gusts of petulance, with the filial
tenderness of a daughter and the patience of a little saint,
she never could win the regard of, and barely earned a smile
from, this strange old woman, whose days and ailments were
now drawing to a close.  Yet, the orphan girl loved this
kinswoman who loved not her, for she had traced something
of her dead mother's features in her face&mdash;a mother for
whom she still sorrowed,&mdash;and she found the best solace for
that grief was to discharge the duties of affection, which
fate had transferred from one sister to the other.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Rose was the sole residuary legatee of her late
husband, an old nabob, who had returned from India with a
visage the colour of the gold he had acquired, and a heart
that had narrowed and shrunk as his liver increased; thus,
her fortune was ample, and, as she was without children, she
had long given her whole thoughts and attention to the welfare
and success of the Rev. Mr. Pawkie's dissenting meeting-house,
of which Macfarisee was an elder, and the porch of which
edifice she had become fully assured was the only avenue to
Heaven; thus, the three had long gone hand-in-hand, in
holding conventicles and meetings for the out-pouring of the
spirit, amid tea, toast, and cold water&mdash;for humiliation,
prayer, and the regeneration of all those wicked and
benighted heathens, who did not occupy pews in the
square-windowed, low-roofed, and barnlike edifice in which the
Rev. Jedediah Pawkie expounded the pure gospel, inspired
by the light that shone from the new Jerusalem, and
consigned to very hot quarters indeed all who took their own
way to Heaven instead of his.
</p>

<p>
Of this fustian spirit of religion and fanaticism, when
combined with an aversion for the only living tie that
existed between her and the world, the worthy Macfarisee&mdash;that
inflexible Mede and upright pillar of the Kirk&mdash;hastened
to take his usual advantage; and in the sequel he
proved himself to be a greater wolf in sheep's clothing
than I could ever have imagined.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br><br>
THE WILL.
</h3>

<p>
While seated in the parlour, into which I had been
ushered, time passed slowly; and the melancholy voice of
Macfarisee, singing a psalm, came drearily and hollowly
through the large corridors of the house, from the sick-room
up stairs.  He was giving ghostly comfort, together with his
legal advice, to the departing sinner, whom I had been
assured was now hovering between time and eternity, and
who, at most, had not many days to live.  Knowing his
character, as I did, there seemed a horrible mockery in the
words of the psalm:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Lord, bow thine ear to my request,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hear me by-and-by;<br>
  With grievous pain and grief opprest,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full poor and weak am I.<br>
  Preserve my soul, because my ways<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And doings holy be;<br>
  And save Thy servant, O my Lord!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who puts his trust in Thee.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
As the quivering voice of Macfarisee emitted this verse, I
could not repress a shudder of disgust and impatience, and
tossed aside the religious tract he had given me; for thus it
is that such professors bring a ridicule on piety itself.
</p>

<p>
I had turned over all the books in the room without
finding one to interest me, as they all belonged to the
literature of cant; but my eyes frequently reverted to the
portrait of a young man in scarlet uniform, for it made me
think of my father's regiment,&mdash;of honest men, and better
things, and days long passed away.  Then I thought of my
mother and of dear little Lotty, and longed to be at home
with them, for the night-wind sighed mournfully through
the old sycamores of Applewood, and my heart grew sad, I
know not why.  Red sheet-lightning occasionally illuminated
the far horizon, and cast forward in black outline the stems
of the trees and their tossing branches.  Then there would
be heard the opening and shutting of doors; the sound of
steps hurriedly upon the well-carpetted stairs.  These made
me fear that the old lady was really dead; and solemn
thoughts came over me, as I gazed down the dark avenue
from the window.  Then I burned with impatience to be
gone, but had to wait, cypher-like, the time and pleasure of
others whom I heartily despised.
</p>

<p>
After the lapse of nearly two hours, Messieurs Quirky
and Macfarisee entered the room.  The cunning eyes of the
latter were half-closed; his grizzled hair was brushed
stiffly up above each ear, till it resembled two horns; and
his chin was buried in his loose white necktie.  The two
legal pundits were so absorbed in conversation as scarcely to
notice me.
</p>

<p>
"She won't last a week, now," said Quirky, in a low
voice.
</p>

<p>
"You think so?"
</p>

<p>
"I am certain of it.  One can never mistake that sad
and dreary expression of the face."
</p>

<p>
"Alas!" said Macfarisee, in his quavering tones, while
upturning the whites of his cunning eyes, "all flesh is grass;
but, Heaven be praised, the blessed truths of our Christian
faith have been poured into her ears by my unworthy
tongue to-night; and not in vain,&mdash;let us hope&mdash;not in
vain!"
</p>

<p>
Quirky made a gesture of impatience; for the spirit of
hypocrisy was so strong in Macfarisee that he was now
getting into the habit of acting to <i>himself</i> as well as to
others.
</p>

<p>
"It is fortunate that this will," said Quirky, unfolding a
slip of paper, "is dated so far back&mdash;fully sixty days ago;
so she may die when she chooses, now."
</p>

<p>
"She is at peace with the Lord&mdash;she hath satisfied <i>Him</i>."
</p>

<p>
"She has satisfied <i>you</i> too, I think; and I doubt not you
consider that a matter of much greater importance; but, of
course, you are aware that a holograph will, like this, does
not convey lands and houses in Scotland?"
</p>

<p>
"Eh?&mdash;what?&mdash;No.  But it conveys furniture, plate, and
pictures; and it can be stamped and recorded on payment
of a fee.  But, alas, as I said, all flesh <i>is</i> grass."
</p>

<p>
"As a legal document, I fear it is valueless," said Quirky,
who, at times, had a strange fancy for teasing his compatriot;
"letters of administration will never be granted
on it."
</p>

<p>
"Damn it, Quirky, don't say so!" said Macfarisee,
forgetting himself in his anger, "after all the trouble this
old woman has given me; confound her obstinacy, that
declined a more legal form until it is now too late."
</p>

<p>
"There will assuredly be a row about it; at least,
unpleasant speculations."
</p>

<p>
"But I shall leave it in the custody of the niece, Amy
Lee, and that will lessen all suspicion."
</p>

<p>
"A good idea&mdash;you are a lucky fellow."
</p>

<p>
"Hush," said Macfarisee, suddenly; "that boy Ellis is
there&mdash;the devil take him!"
</p>

<p>
"Where?"
</p>

<p>
"At the table, reading&mdash;Shakspear, I have no doubt,
though I have often told him that poetry is a device of the
evil one.  Mr. Ellis," he added in his blandest voice,
handing me the folded document, "seal up this and address
it to Miss Lee; a desk is open there, and you will find
materials."
</p>

<p>
"In what way shall I do it?" I stammered, somewhat
confused by having been forced to overhear a conversation
so singular in character.
</p>

<p>
"Do it&mdash;do it&mdash;what d'ye mean?" asked Quirky with
great crossness of manner.
</p>

<p>
"Young man," added our Nathaniel, "the scripture
sayeth, 'whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it, with thy
might.'  Seal it up with Mrs. Rose's seal, which I see lying
there on the desk, and address it to her niece."
</p>

<p>
After this they retired into the bay of a window, and
conversed for fully ten minutes in low and earnest whispers.
Curious to learn what a sheet of note-paper (for it was
nothing more) could contain in the form of a will, while
slowly and carefully making an envelope, I read the whole
at a glance, and, so nearly as I can remember, it ran
somewhat in this fashion.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
"Applewood, 10th August, 1791.
</p>

<p>
"I leave to my niece Amy Lee twenty guineas to purchase
anything she pleases, as a remembrance of me; but
I leave all my property and everything I possess, personal
and heritable, Applewood, its house and lands, carriages,
horses, cattle, pictures, books, and plate, as per catalogue,
to Mr. Nathaniel Macfarisee, my approved friend and dear
and worthy brother in the Lord, and him I appoint my
sole executor and residuary legatee.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"PRUDENCE ROSE."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
This strange and brief document, so terrible in its
contents for the unfortunate niece, was written in the
tremulous handwriting of the aunt; and was witnessed by
Quirky and Macfarisee, whose names were also appended
thereto.  However, all this was no business of mine; my
orders were imperative; I folded, sealed, and addressed it
to Miss Lee, who at that moment entered the room, and
just as Macfarisee, with his peculiar cunning, wrote his
initials <i>above the seal</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Thank Heaven, sir," said she to Macfarisee, "my poor
aunt sleeps at last!"
</p>

<p>
"My humble ministration hath soothed her perturbed
spirit," said he, taking the pale girl's delicate and white
hand in his, and caressing it kindly; "but we must now
depart, and into your custody we commit this sealed document.
Keep it carefully until I ask for it again, and my
dear, dear child, you are on no account whatever to break the
seal or show it to any one, least of all to your worthy aunt,
whose state of health will not permit her to survive much
agitation.  I know I can trust to your excellent discretion,
child; for, as the scripture saith, 'Many daughters have
done virtuously, but <i>thou</i> excellest them all!'"
</p>

<p>
He kissed her on the cheek, as he frequently did young
girls of his congregation (our modern saint had a weakness
that way), and then retired with his mincing step, with a
groan on his lips for the nothingness of this life, and a smile
in his stealthy eye at his own success.  His partner followed
with the same cat-like bearing.
</p>

<p>
For a moment, boy as I was, I stood bewildered by the
astounding game Macfarisee was playing; and with a glance
of commiseration at the handsome young girl, who,
all-unconscious of the evil intended for her, with trembling
white hands was securing the sealed document in her desk,
while her charming face was hidden by her dark ringlets as
she bent forward.  Then I hastened after my august
employers, who had now reached the door of the house.
Here they paused, and Mr. Quirky patted me on the back,
saying,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You are a sharp and intelligent lad, Oliver."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; a most discreet, quiet lad, and not a talker,"
added the junior partner.  "We like you very much,
Oliver."
</p>

<p>
As they never praised me before (in fact, I was a very idle
dog), I bowed with a perplexed air, and asked myself what
the deuce was in the wind now?
</p>

<p>
"We have a little piece of business for you to do," said
Macfarisee, "and you must remain here for a few days to
perform it."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Here?</i>" I reiterated.
</p>

<p>
"Here, my dear sir."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;but, sir, for what purpose?"
</p>

<p>
"Not so fast, young man," said Quirky, in his usual
grating tones.  "You will remain here until you have copied
the catalogues of movable effects, which shall be shown to
you by the housekeeper and steward; the more complete
these lists are made, the longer time you will have here to
enjoy yourself.  They are required," he added in a whisper,
"with reference to the last testament of Mrs. Rose.  As
soon as the copies are made, get them signed by Miss Lee,
the steward, and housekeeper, and return to town.  You
understand me, sir."
</p>

<p>
"The fact is, my dear young man, Mrs. Rose is not very
strong in health or intellect just now, and we are afraid she
may add some stupid codicil to her will, especially if her
husband's brother, Colonel Rose, returns from India.  You will
be left here ostensibly to prepare these lists of her movable
property; but the moment <i>he</i> arrives (and he is expected
shortly), start for town, and let me know."
</p>

<p>
"And so I am to be left here?" I asked ponderingly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"How long?"
</p>

<p>
"A week&mdash;it may be a fortnight&mdash;you understand."
</p>

<p>
I did not understand; but I afterwards divined that I
was to be our Nathaniel's spy upon the old lady and her
household.
</p>

<p>
"My mother at home will believe I am lost."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, without fail I shall make the good lady aware that
I have detained you on special business."
</p>

<p>
All this thoughtfulness and unwonted politeness sorely
puzzled me for a time.
</p>

<p>
"You will find plenty of amusement here&mdash;a fine house
and fine grounds&mdash;books and pictures in plenty.  It will be
quite a vacation for you."
</p>

<p>
"They are fortunate who possess such," said I with a sigh,
as I thought of my mother's little cottage.
</p>

<p>
"Young man, be not guilty of envy or covetousness, but
work hard and pray that God may keep you poor rather
than rich; for wealth leadeth to pleasures and employments
which are abominations and vanities in the sight of Heaven;
so work, I say, for man was born to earn his bread by the
sweat of his brow; and so good night.  Do not forget your
prayers at bed-time, and to attend church on Sunday while
you are here."
</p>

<p>
Macfarisee bowed and smiled through the window as the
hackney-coach was driven off; and I knew well that when
<i>he</i> smiled, it was with mockery in his heart and mischief in
his soul.
</p>

<p>
In a minute more, the sounds of the wheels had died
away under the trees of the gravelled avenue; and with a
feeling of loneliness, and something of dread, lest those two
men were preparing a snare for me, bewildered by all that
was passing through my mind, I returned to the parlour
which I had just left.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br><br>
AMY LEE.
</h3>

<p>
In my career there have been some days and incidents
to which I shall ever look back with pleasure and delight,
and among these I number my brief sojourn at Applewood.
</p>

<p>
Amy Lee received me with a blush of pleasure on her
pale and somewhat saddened young face, for the atmosphere
of the sick-room and the dull life she led had impressed her
features with premature thought; and when seated with
her at supper in the long dining-room of Applewood, with
the wigged and breastplated portraits of past generations
staring down upon us from the walls, with plate and
crystal glittering on the table, amid the wax-lights of the
chandelier and girandoles, and with two servants in showy
livery attending us, I felt all the sudden novelty of the
situation with an emotion of delight at the beauty of the
young girl.
</p>

<p>
The loss of her parents, travel, the scenes she had seen
in India, and the life she had since led with her aunt, made
Amy older than her years, and thoughtful in her youth.
Motherless and fatherless almost from infancy, Amy had
been, like myself, early accustomed to rely upon her own
reflections and resources.  Her father was an officer who
had served long and faithfully in Indian wars; thus we had
much that was in common between us, and in five minutes
were as intimate as old friends.
</p>

<p>
The musical inflections of her voice had in them a chord
which proved singularly seductive.  The smile in her
dark-blue eyes was full of drollery and sadness by turns&mdash;of
witchery always&mdash;and the extreme blackness of their lashes,
when contrasted with the whiteness of their nervous lids,
lent a darker tint to them at all times,&mdash;a deeper colour than
they really possessed.
</p>

<p>
Boylike, I felt a fond and sudden interest in this attractive
girl; but to tell the secret I possessed&mdash;to reveal what hung
over her, the wrong her nearest relative meditated,&mdash;would
be to betray and impeach the supposed-to-be irreproachable
Macfarisee; thus I was troubled, restless, and wretched,
amid the charms of her presence and of her society; and
while she poured out wine for me, with little hands that
trembled when they grasped the heavy crystal decanters,
and selected the best fruit in the salvers for my plate, acting
the hostess with a grace peculiarly her own, when she chatted
and smiled to me, I relapsed frequently into silence and
thought.
</p>

<p>
"And the task for which you have been left here is to
prepare some inventories for my aunt?" she observed, after
one of those awkward pauses which at times ensue in the
conversation of strangers.
</p>

<p>
"It would seem so."
</p>

<p>
"Alas! she will never be able to examine them."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," said I bitterly, "Mr. Nathaniel Macfarisee is sufficiently
interested in the documents to relieve the poor lady
of all trouble in that matter."
</p>

<p>
"He is so very good and kind.  Dear Mr. Macfarisee!"
</p>

<p>
"I am glad you think so."
</p>

<p>
"You will have a frightful deal of trouble, Mr. Ellis.
Why did not Mr. Macfarisee remain himself, or leave some
one else to assist you?"
</p>

<p>
"I know not," was my reply, though I knew very well;
for my discretion and silence were more readily to be relied
on than those of others in the employment of the worthy
triumvirate.
</p>

<p>
"And you will be here&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"A week, Mr. Quirky said; perhaps a fortnight."
</p>

<p>
"A whole week!  I am so glad of that; you will be
quite a companion for me," she exclaimed, clapping her
hands with girlish pleasure, while I reflected that to spend
a week in this house, with such a girl, was assuredly the
most delightful piece of office-work that had occurred to
me since I became the legal pupil of Messrs. Harpy, Quirky,
and Macfarisee.
</p>

<p>
"Your aunt, Mrs. Rose, has long been ill, I believe."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, for years, and has endured such pain in all parts of
her body, that I am astonished her soul has not been put
to flight&mdash;poor woman!&mdash;long since."
</p>

<p>
"But I have read somewhere that the soul is not in the
body, but in the brain&mdash;I think Locke says so," said I,
becoming learned as the wine inflamed me, and the
decanters on the table seemed alternately to multiply and
decrease in number.
</p>

<p>
"I never read Locke," replied Miss Lee, laughing; "but
I feel assured that it is in the heart."
</p>

<p>
"I have no doubt every young beauty supposes so; but if
we think long&mdash;and thought is the action of the soul&mdash;it
becomes weary, for the <i>head</i> aches."
</p>

<p>
"But if we suffer long anxiety, or are in love, does not
the heart ache?"
</p>

<p>
"I do not know&mdash;I never was in love.  Were <i>you</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"No; how can you ask me such a question?"
</p>

<p>
We both blushed furiously now, as a boy and girl might
do, and cast down our eyes; then as our hands came in
contact, how I knew not, unless it was that Amy searched
for the nut-crackers and I hastened to assist her, we both
trembled, and were seriously overcome by confusion.
</p>

<p>
At that moment a clock struck in the hall.
</p>

<p>
"Heavens," exclaimed Miss Lee, "it is twelve o'clock;
we have been conversing, and never reflecting that we
cannot stop time."
</p>

<p>
"But you have made me forget its flight," said I, in a
low voice.
</p>

<p>
This was a gallant speech for a lad of seventeen, and as
such, I have thought fit to record it here.
</p>

<p>
Another little pause ensued, and fortunately her aunt's
bell rang sharply, so she begged to be excused and
hurriedly left me.  For some time I waited her return;
but she came no more that night, or morning rather, and I
retired to bed, my heart filled with new impulses, and my
head with new visions and fancies.  When closing my eyes
on the pillow, I seemed still to see before me the long
lashes, the delicate hands, and thick dark curls of Amy Lee,
while her sweet merry tones lingered in my ear.  I was
restless, and the dawn almost came ere I slept, with the full
intention of setting about Macfarisee's obnoxious business in
the morning.
</p>

<p>
With the new day I was more bewildered than ever; for
nearly the whole of it was spent in sketching certain
picturesque sycamores of the avenue in the young lady's
album, and writing love verses on the embossed "Bristols"
and pink and peagreen leaves thereof; or in rambling about
the lawn, feeding the peacocks, visiting the preserves of gold
and silver pheasants (long undisturbed by the echo of a gun-shot),
and studying the language of flowers in the conservatory;
so if inventories of plate and pictures were requisite
to complete the earthly happiness of Mr. Nathaniel
Macfarisee, he was exceedingly unlikely to get them from me.
</p>

<p>
Amy's consolation and companions in the lonely life she
led had long been her birds, her flowers, her music, and her
own thoughts, when not occupied by attendance upon her
ailing, besotted, and ascetic relative, whose sentiment of
revenge, cherished against her mother, combined with the
warp which the evil influence of Macfarisee's subtle mind
and oily tongue had given an intellect already unhinged by
time, disease, and the homilies of the Reverend Mr. Pawkie,
had led her ultimately to pen the absurd and wicked
testament already referred to, and to do the poor girl a
deadly wrong, by robbing her of all that was hers by right
of inheritance, by law, and justice, for the enrichment of a
stranger.

CHAPTER VII.
<br><br>
TWO YOUNG HEARTS.
</h3>

<p>
Thrown together as we were in that great and lonely house,
meeting so often at meals and elsewhere, it was impossible for
us to escape being mutually attracted; "for in youth,"
as some one says, "it seems so natural to love and be beloved,
that we scarcely know how to value the first devotion of
the entire and trusting heart;" and so it proved with one
of us.
</p>

<p>
The secluded neighbourhood of Applewood,&mdash;the state
of her aunt's health, together with that lady's eccentric and
severe habits and strange views of life and of the world,
caused her society to be little courted; thus, Amy saw few
other visitors than Macfarisee, and other pious sinners, who
occupied high places in the synagogue presided over by the
Reverend Mr. Pawkie, and none of whom were famous for
hiding their candles "under a bushel," preferring to set
them on the very summit thereof; consequently, my sojourn
at Applewood, whatever the purpose that sent me there,
was rather an event in the lonely life of the young girl.
</p>

<p>
Since those days, I have told others&mdash;many others&mdash;whose
names may never appear in this chequered narrative, that I
loved them, and each avowal came more easy from my lips
than the last; but it seemed to me as if the link was not so
tender, the faith was not so deep, or the love so true, as
those I bore for bonnie Amy Lee.
</p>

<p>
When she could steal from her aunt's room, we were
always together, for Amy knitted bead-purses, made up
significant bouquets from the conservatory, read novels, and
when we interchanged <i>underlined</i> passages from the poets,
showed she had talents for flirtation equal to most young
ladies.  A week slipped away without any tidings arriving
from my employers, and without the arrival of Colonel Rose
from India, to raise the siege which has been so long and
so successfully laid to his sister-in-law, to whom his deceased
brother had so foolishly given the entire control of all he
had acquired in the Carnatic, where, at the head of his
sepoys, he had bombarded the nabob and looted the dingy
natives to some purpose and to some profit.
</p>

<p>
The life I led was entirely new to me.  I was daily
associating with this charming young girl, at an age when first
the female form begins to awaken new and undefined ideas
of delight in the mind of a half-grown youth, and it was
impossible for me not to feel all its influences.
</p>

<p>
In the early morning, when the sun rose above the hills,
half veiled in clouds of purple and of gold, and when the
battlemented castle, the old grey mansions, and churches of
the distant city, seemed to float amid the silver mist that
rose from the dewy hollows, we rambled together in the
walks of the garden, or on the smooth green velvet lawn,
when the first buoyant breeze came over the upland slope,
and when the first beam of the tremulous sunshine lit up the
dewy leaves; when the birds twitted from branch to branch,
shaking off the dew-like diamond drops, and we felt our
breasts expand, and our young hearts grow glad and joyous,
we knew not why, though poor Amy Lee was often pale
with the long vigils she spent by the sick-bed of her aunt.
The active mind and real goodness of heart possessed by
Amy lent a living light to her eyes and to her features,
filling them with a beauty beyond what they might
otherwise have possessed.
</p>

<p>
We were daily together in the sunny little breakfast-parlour,
which opened into the brightly-flowered shelves
of the conservatory; and then Amy, clad in the most
becoming of frilled morning dresses, with her little white
hands poured out my coffee, &amp;c., and charmingly did the
honours of our little table&mdash;and then, thereafter in wandering
and in dreams, would pass the day, until evening, when&mdash;thank
heaven!&mdash;the old dame upstairs was cosily tucked
in for the night; and then we rambled through the long
avenues and evergreen shrubberies, while the brilliant moon
shed her silver rays athwart the tall lines of aged sycamores,
around which the tendrils of the dark ivy clung; and when
the diamond stars shone above in the purest of ether, and we
dreamed on, and talked of a thousand things, or often were
silent, for at times silence is more eloquent than words,
while only the breeze stirred the foliage overhead, and all
else was hushed save the beating of our hearts&mdash;amid
circumstances so conducive to the growth of boyish love and
to philandering, who the deuce could resist the passion?
Certainly not a day-dreamer like Oliver Ellis.
</p>

<p>
A second week had nearly elapsed when I received a
letter from Macfarisee, announcing, in his curt fashion, that
the sooner I returned to town the better, with the papers
he had left me to prepare&mdash;and to tell Miss Lee that Colonel
Rose had arrived in London.
</p>

<p>
The papers!  Until then I had forgotten all about them;
and then there was the colonel&mdash;for reasons of my own, I
felt quite as anxious about him as the worthy conveyancer
Macfarisee could have done.
</p>

<p>
"And what is the colonel, Amy?" I asked, as we sat in
a seat of the conservatory, with my arm round her waist, her
cheek resting on my shoulder, and her thick curls half
enveloping my face.
</p>

<p>
"An officer of Indian cavalry.  I know nothing more."
</p>

<p>
"Coming home with a fortune&mdash;gout in his legs, and
cotton in his ears; a blue coat with brass buttons&mdash;a yellow
face and a bamboo cane."
</p>

<p>
"Why so?"
</p>

<p>
"All colonels who come from India appear so."
</p>

<p>
"Nay," said she, looking up with her droll eyes, "he is a
handsome young dragoon."
</p>

<p>
"Young!"
</p>

<p>
"His portrait is in the parlour."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, I remember; but it must have been taken long ago."
</p>

<p>
"He was nearly twenty years younger than his brother,
my uncle; and it has been arranged by my aunt and
Mr. Macfarisee, that he takes me out to India with him when he
returns."
</p>

<p>
"Wherefore to India, Amy?" I asked in a quavering
voice, as my bubble seemed on the point of dissolving.
</p>

<p>
"Because they say I am alone here."
</p>

<p>
"Alone?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Did they not add, that all European girls&mdash;especially
pretty ones&mdash;make good marriages there?"
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Amy laughing, "I confess they did."
</p>

<p>
"I would kill your husband if I saw him!" said I, while
a gesture of sadness and impatience escaped me.
</p>

<p>
"There&mdash;there now, don't be cross, dear Oliver, and I
will say nothing to offend you again," said the playful girl,
placing her soft little hands on each of my cheeks, and
pressing her cherry lips to mine.  "Don't speak so, pray."
</p>

<p>
"And this dreary task I have to do&mdash;to copy those lists
of plate, pictures, and rubbish,&mdash;I shall never get on with
them!" I exclaimed with impatience, as a loathing for
business returned to me.
</p>

<p>
"Not unless you begin&mdash;but I shall be so glad to help
you."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, dearest Amy."
</p>

<p>
"Here are the steward's and house-keeper's books, which
contain all the information you require, and there is my
desk in the parlour&mdash;it is open; to work, then, at once, and
in a few minutes I will rejoin you."
</p>

<p>
"So deluded and unsuspecting!" thought I, while seating
myself at her desk, as she lightly hastened to attend
her querulous patient, and I dipped my pen in the
ink-stand, and dreamily turned over a sheet or two of paper,
and saw before me&mdash;what?&mdash;the identical will which I
supposed to have been committed to Amy's custody, and
which assigned Applewood and all it contained to Macfarisee
and the heirs of his body, and which Amy had never seen,
as since that night she had never opened her desk.
</p>

<p>
Until then, in the delightful dream of the passed days,
I had almost forgotten the will and all about it; and now,
it would seem, that in my haste and confusion on the night
I first came to Applewood, I had folded, sealed up, and
addressed a sheet of <i>blank</i> note paper, the exact size of the
holograph will, while leaving that document open, among
the writing materials in Miss Lee's desk.  Here was a
fortunate mistake.
</p>

<p>
For a moment I was bewildered by this startling
discovery.  My first impulse was to open the old envelope,
and reseal it, as originally directed by the orders of
Macfarisee, but I must have torn the envelope through his
<i>initials</i>; my second impulse was to read over once again
the contents of the will; then, as the whole web of
hypocrisy and wrong unfolded itself more vividly before me,
and the sweet face of Amy, on one hand, was contrasted
with the odious idea of Macfarisee on the other, I twisted
up the paper, to procure which he had spent years of prayer
and hypocrisy, fawning and twaddle.  I then tossed it into
the fire, and in a moment it was consumed!
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br><br>
FROM POETRY TO PROSE AGAIN.
</h3>

<p>
After two weeks of joy and pleasure, I found myself
again in the establishment of those limbs of the law,
Messrs. Harpy, Quirky, and Macfarisee, and chained, as it
were, to my inkspotted desk, like the son of Clymene to his
rock; overlooking the miserable back-court, where the two
old and half-dead Dutch poplars, surrounded by smoke-blackened
walls of stone, vegetated feebly among the soot
that covered their leaves, and the dust that was washed
down from the eaves of adjacent houses.  Then, when
looking on their sickly verdure, and the lonely sparrow,
evidently a misanthrope, that hopped from branch to branch,
I thought of the green shady avenue of sycamores, and
sighed for the grassy slopes, the brilliant flower-garden, the
thick copses, and the blue-eyed fairy of Applewood.
</p>

<p>
If application to work had been repugnant to me before,
it was insupportable now.  I had ever in my ears the voice
of Amy Lee, and before me all her pretty ways, her thick
black tresses and her soft bright eyes.  My hours of reverie
were hours of happiness; for then I shut out the external
world to commune with my own thoughts, and this beautiful
girl was the planet around which they all revolved,&mdash;the
guiding star to which I turned.
</p>

<p>
Poor though I was, and all but friendless,&mdash;timid as a
boy and a lover, I did not shrink from raising my eyes to
Amy Lee, whose hand might have been sought by the
wealthiest proprietors in the county; but after I returned
to town, our meetings were casual, and seemed far, so very
far, between.  And so I dreamed on, even my old
aspirations after the rattle of the drum and the smoke of
gunpowder being, for the time, almost forgotten.
</p>

<p>
I knew the church which her aunt's household attended;
it was a branch of Mr. Jedediah Pawkie's establishment, and
was nearly ten miles distant from ours; yet I often walked
there on Sunday, that I might see Amy,&mdash;might be under
the same roof with her, and when she bowed to me, as we
left the church porch together, her smile, so full of
brightness, welcome, and meaning, sent me home happy,&mdash;happy
over the hills, amid gusts of wind and winter snow.  Her
weekly smile rewarded me for hours of toil, of dull drudgery,
and nameless, hopeless longings.
</p>

<p>
I had never thought of Amy as my wife.  Boy-like, all I
knew, and felt, or cared for, was, that I loved this girl and
desired to be loved in return.  My wife!  At seventeen,
the idea would have frightened me.  I, so poor,&mdash;I, who
had the great battle of life to fight&mdash;to combat manfully for
bread, and who saw no certain future, not even that vague
but bright horizon which the eye of every imaginative boy
sees; a horizon that too often recedes, grows fainter, and
disappears as years roll on, like the waves of ocean, with
their many hues, their sorrows and their changes.
</p>

<p>
Love for my mother on one hand, and this new love for
Amy on the other, now combined to inspire me.  I toiled
and struggled on at my desk and at my studies, hoping for
some change, as the young and ardent ever hope, against
fate itself; but alas for the poor human heart, when honest
pride, honour, and laudable ambition have to contend with
stern adversity, wealthy snobbery, or successful hypocrisy!
</p>

<p>
The servitude which was exacted from me, and the
absurd hauteur with which I was treated, were fast
increasing my abhorrence of an occupation which had nothing
to relieve its monotony.  I was glad when the dreary hours
of business were over, and I was permitted to snatch my
hat and rush home.  There to Lotty I would pour out all
the bitterness of my discontent, and whisper of my secret
longings after scenes more stirring and congenial, for the
conviction was daily growing stronger in my heart, that
</p>

<p class="poem">
  One crowded hour of glorious life<br>
  Was worth an age without a name!<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
But my mother soothed and calmed, if she failed to alter
my views.  Ever ready to console and advise with gentleness,
she led my soul from angry bitterness and useless
repining to purer hopes and holier wishes; and the knowledge
that she loved me so dearly, and that her kind heart
was full of maternal affection, anxiety, and hope for us,
would make me resolve to bear all for her sake, till next
day perhaps, when some new act of insolence or oppression on
the part of my underbred taskmasters would again rouse all
my slumbering fury.
</p>

<p>
Amid all this, my day-dreams would come again and
again; my visions of being a soldier, or anything else but
what I was then.
</p>

<p>
Now I was ploughing the deep green ocean, the white
sails of an imaginary ship swelling out in the pure
sea-breeze, the waves rolling around me in foam and
sunshine&mdash;ploughing it to lands that were covered with waving
foliage, with brilliant verdure and glowing fruit&mdash;to sunny
isles that lay I knew not where&mdash;but
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Where things that own not man's dominion dwell,<br>
  And mortal foot hath ne'er or rarely been.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Certainly the island of Robinson Crusoe stood most vividly
out among them, with Amy Lee, however, as a substitute
for his dingy comrade Friday.  Now I was an actor&mdash;a
successful one, of course&mdash;amid the glare of tinsel and the
footlights, bringing down thunders of applause from the
gods and wreaths of laurel from the boxes.  Now I was a
shepherd, as we find him pourtrayed by Watteau or
described in the pastorals of Virgil, cased in hairy buskins,
enjoying his <i>otium</i> under a spreading oak, crowned with
dark-green ivy, playing to his flocks on an oaten reed and
enjoying curds and cream with Corydon and Thyrsis.
Occasionally I thought that being a captain of Sicilian or
Italian banditti, in easy circumstances, inhabiting a
picturesque cavern, in front of which girls were always dancing
with tambourines and tabors, while I wore a handsome
dress with bell-buttons, bandaged legs, and a steeple-crowned
hat, disporting long flowing ribbons&mdash;or that
figuring as a buccaneer, with a cocked hat and brace of
pistols (like Paul Jones in the popular prints), might not
be an unpleasant mode of life; but amid all these vagaries,
the old stereotyped idea of being a soldier ever came vividly
forth, as the most favourite of my boyish dreams.  <i>Then</i> I
was in uniform&mdash;a sword in my hand and the sharp blast
of the trumpet in my ear.  I was on the march to
imaginary fields of fame and honour.  Thus a thousand
bright shadows were ever floating before me, and my
reading fed this fancy, folly if you will, rendering me
careless of work, and embroiling me yet further with those
who entrusted it to me.
</p>

<p>
The bronzed but kind and jovial faces of my father's
men&mdash;the men of "the regiment" far away&mdash;men who had nursed
me, toyed with me, and borne me on their backs in sportive
merriment, were never forgotten.  My heart swelled with
the memory, and the sight of a red-coat ever brought them
all before me; for, as dear old Corporal Trim said of the
son of Le Fevre, the poor dying lieutenant, "I had been
bred up from an infant in the army, and the name of a
<i>soldier</i> sounded in my ears like the name of a <i>friend</i>."

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br><br>
SEQUEL TO THE STORY OF THE WILL.
</h3>

<p>
One morning it had come to the ears of Mr. Nathaniel
Macfarisee that I had been discovered in the pit of the
Theatre Royal, seeing Stephen Kemble and the Queen
Katherine of Mrs. Siddons&mdash;that, in addition to being in
this place of sin, which Mr. Pawkie weekly denounced as
the avenue to a very hot climate indeed, I had applauded,
by clapping my hands in an unseemly manner, and in the
exuberance of my agitation or excitement during the dying
scene, had snatched off the well-powdered wig of an old
gentleman who sat before me, "a most grave and reverend
signior," Mr. Macrocodile, the City Chamberlain, and tossed
it up to the great lustre, amid the crystal labyrinths of which
it remained: all of which enormities drew upon me a
most severe lecture, interlarded with many texts of scripture,
from our upright and good Nathaniel, who professed
the greatest horror of playhouses, and valued a Siddons or a
Kemble no more than the painted mountebank who plays
with bowls and balls, or the Chinese who swallows a barrowfull
of paper shavings, and emits thereafter a hundred yards
of fine satin ribbon.
</p>

<p>
In the midst of his dreary and impertinent harangue, to
which I listened with fortitude, if not with Christian
resignation, Mr. Quirky approached with a black-edged letter in
his hand, and with a curious smirking expression in his eye.
It was from Amy Lee, to announce that her aunt was dead,
and "begging that dear, good, kind soul, Mr. Macfarisee" to
come down to Applewood&mdash;that she was to be buried in
three days, and, fortunately, that Colonel Rose had arrived."
</p>

<p>
Smiles of mutual intelligence and satisfaction were
exchanged by the friendly partners, and Quirky, after a
whisper, warmly and in a congratulatory manner, shook the
hand of the "dear, good, kind Macfarisee," who had just
returned from a meeting of Elders in Mr. Pawkie's vestry,
where Mr. Macrocodile had read a paper on the moral
obliquity of the Zulu Caffres, a subject "anent" which the
said congregation had long been in sore affliction.
</p>

<p>
"Well, well," said he, getting up a profound sigh, "had I
known that she was in such sore extremity four days ago,
we might have had her prayed for in the kirk; but, verily,
she has gone from this vale of tears to the place of her just
reward, and a friend so dear to me, I would not wish back
on earth again."
</p>

<p>
Quirky scrutinised the face of his friend, to see if there
was any irony concealed under this remark; but from
Macfarisee's visage nothing could be gathered.  It was deep
as the crater of Etna.  However, that day he and Quirky
started at full speed for Applewood, where, as I afterwards
heard, they treated poor Amy with very little ceremony
and less commiseration, but carefully sealed up every
drawer, press, and lockfast place.
</p>

<p>
On the funeral day, Macfarisee appeared accoutred with
those white trimmings on the cuffs of his coat, named in
Scotland "weepers;" but his were of the largest size, being
nearly three inches broad.  An enormous bow of crape
decorated his hat, and streamed down his back in testimony
of his unparalleled affliction.  His face wore an unusually
lugubrious expression, for this gentleman was a profound
actor; and with great solemnity of manner he gave me a
green bag, containing several dockets of papers, the
catalogues of worldly effects, as I shrewdly suspected; and
calling for a hackney, we drove off, accompanied by
Mr. Quirky, also attired in sable garb of woe, but not of such
unutterable depth as his deeper companion.
</p>

<p>
The season was winter now, the severe winter of 1791.
The woods were bare and leafless, and the white glistening
snow covered all the upland slopes and distant hills.  The
wayside runnels were congealed, and hard as flint.  The
breath of the hackney horses curled like smoke from their
nostrils, while their hoofs clinked and rung on the frozen
roadway; the icicles hung like long pendants from the
eaves of the cottages, and from their chimneys the smoke
ascended in straight columns to a vast height through the
rarified atmosphere.  The poor robins chirped drearily on
the bare twigs, and everything bore evidence of a keen cold
Scottish winter, as we whirled along; but now my heart beat
light and merrily.  In an hour or less I might see Amy,
and be under the same roof with her&mdash;the bright-eyed,
black-haired Amy; and now I began to perceive the full
value of the service I had done her.
</p>

<p>
At last we wheeled into the well-known avenue of old
sycamores.
</p>

<p>
"Hah, we are just in time," said Macfarisee, consulting
his huge gold repeater, as we drew up at the pillared portico,
before which stood a hearse surmounted by those hideous
and fantastic sable plumes, which cast a mockery on real
grief; and along the avenue stood a train of hackney
coaches covered with crape, for such was then the fashion.
</p>

<p>
"Ay, sir, you are just in time," said an old servant in
livery, opening the coach door; "the minister is gaun' to
pray before the liften' o' the kist."
</p>

<p>
I surveyed the fellow, to see if there was any regret
expressed in his hard-lined visage, but not a vestige could be
traced in them or in his tone, though he was one of
Mr. Pawkie's most exemplary flock.
</p>

<p>
Above the portico hung an escutcheon, of the fashion
peculiar to Scotland, France, and Germany&mdash;lozenge-form,
and six feet square, of black cloth&mdash;containing the complete
achievements of the deceased, with the sixteen coats of the
families from whom she derived her gentility; for, though
Macfarisee and the late Mrs. Prudence Rose affected to
despise heraldry as worldly folly and empty vanity, Colonel
Rose, of the M. N. Cavalry, and late Ambassador to His
Highness the Nabob of Chutneybogglywallah, thought very
differently; and hence this huge affair, powdered with
almost the only tears seen on the occasion (save in Amy's
eyes), met us face to face as we entered the mansion of
Applewood.
</p>

<p>
I will hasten over these matter-of-fact details of my earlier
life, as I am anxious to come to events of a more stirring
and congenial nature; but, somehow, I have got into this
story of a "will," and must finish it.
</p>

<p>
The whole of the servants and other dependents were in
deep mourning, and assembled with other persons in the
large dining-room of Applewood; most of them wore the
serious and thoughtful expression of face usually seen at a
Scottish funeral; but others had grave visages, specially got
up (like their starched neckcloths and muslin weepers) for
the occasion.  There was a solemn importance over all,
while wine was poured out, and cakes were served on
silver salvers by the servants and undertakers' men.  The
blinds were all drawn down, and, in the old fashion, the
furniture and mirrors were carefully shrouded by white
coverings.
</p>

<p>
The air without was clear, ambient, and full of frost and
sunshine; the trees were glittering and the clouds sailing in
the clear blue sky.  Everything seemed sparkling and
instinct with life.  No one would have imagined that Death
was within arm's length of us, but for the lugubrious
countenances and sombre garb of those around.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Rose, a tall and soldier-like man, clad in a
fashionably-made suit of mourning, and bearing a well-bred but
somewhat indifferent air, stood with his back to the fire,
and his legs planted on the hearth-rug, a custom usually
acquired in barracks and orderly-rooms.  He was conversing
with ease, but in an undertone, to Macfarisee, who turned
up the white of his cunning eyes, and groaned from time to
time, while expatiating on the transcendant merits of the
deceased; till the colonel, who had never seen his sister-in-law
before, and was tolerably indifferent on the subject of
her religion and piety, the pure form of which had never
reached to Chutneybogglywallah, seemed bored, and he
fairly walked away, when the Rev. Jedediah Pawkie
approached to open fire in the same manner.
</p>

<p>
"So at last the poor old lady is no more," said the pastor,
adjusting his weepers over his black gloves and lengthening
his already elongated visage.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, at last," snuffled Macfarisee.  "Oh Lord," he added,
profanely quoting the psalmist (for in <i>him</i> it was profanity),
"how manifold are thy works" (here he took a glass of wine),
"in wisdom hast thou made them all!"
</p>

<p>
To what this outburst was specially applicable, none could
perceive&mdash;nor did it matter.  He covered his face with his
cambric handkerchief, and affected to become absorbed in
prayer; then, above the low hum of conversation that rose
from those assembled, no sound could be heard but the sobs
of poor Amy, who was attired in black silk, with deep
flounces of crape.  I could not resist drawing near, and
twice stole her hand into mine; but so full was she of her
own thoughts, that she made no response at that time.
</p>

<p>
"Weep, child&mdash;weep!" said Macfarisee, sidling over to
her (with his creaking shoes, which suggested comfort
at every step), and patting her beautiful head; "it is
good for you&mdash;grief is a natural portion of our transitory
and miserable life here below.  Ah&mdash;ah!" he added, shaking
his head, and imbibing another glass of the full-bodied old
port, "what a world it is&mdash;what a world!"
</p>

<p>
A long prayer, dull as ditchwater, was now emitted by
the Rev. Jedediah Pawkie, who was formerly minister of
Skittle Kirk, but had dissented on some new form of Church
government.  During the emission of the "soul-feeding
discourse," as it was termed, Mr. Macrocodile (who,
remembering the episode of the wig, frequently frowned at me)
groaned several times heavily; and Mr. Macfarisee shed
many tears, and, to all appearance, was deeply moved.  I
must own that this exhibition confounded me.  To see a
rogue smile when dissembling is nothing new; but to see
one shedding tears, during the same process, was rather a
novelty.  He was then acting to himself, as well as for
others.  After the prayer, he added a few words of his own,
to the effect "that his only desire, when this sublunary
existence was over&mdash;when he had passed through this valley
of tears and of the shadow of death&mdash;um&mdash;um&mdash;was a
reunion with his dear&mdash;um&mdash;um&mdash;spiritual sister,
in&mdash;um&mdash;um&mdash;eternity."
</p>

<p>
At last the prolonged religious service was over; the
company, in sables, crape, and weepers, issued forth from the
dining-room, and filled the carriages, and drew up the
glasses, that they might laugh and talk at their ease&mdash;at
least, unseen by the servants, tenants, and other rank and
file, who followed on foot in the rear; and then the funeral
train rolled slowly along the gravelled avenue&mdash;the lofty
hearse, with its forest of sable plumage, nodding under the
tall sycamores, as it led the way to the old family vault, in
the ancient and secluded parish burial-ground, which lay a
few miles off.
</p>

<p>
All became silent in the spacious mansion, where Amy
Lee and I were left with the females of the establishment.
</p>

<p>
Amy passed into the garden; I followed, and found her
seated in her favourite arbour, which was formed of thick
cypress and holly.  She had only tied a handkerchief over
her thick dark hair, and looked very pretty and piquant, as
she smiled sadly, and held out her little hands to me in
welcome, as I approached.
</p>

<p>
"I knew you would follow me," said she.
</p>

<p>
"Dear, dear Amy," I exclaimed, and pressed her to my
breast.
</p>

<p>
Then she burst into tears and relapsed into silence, for
the events of the past week, and more especially of that
solemn day, had overpowered her.  She placed her cheek
upon my shoulder, and thus we sat reclined together and
hand in hand, full of thought and in silence, heedless of the
keen and frosty air, for&mdash;I know not how long&mdash;but until
we heard the sound of carriages driven rapidly along the
hard frozen highway, between the leafless hedgerows, and
then over the rough gravel of the echoing avenue, as Colonel
Rose, and a few more of those friends who conceived
themselves to be more immediately concerned, returned, to be
present at the reading of the will&mdash;as Mr. Quirky had
confidentially assured all, of the existence of one.
</p>

<p>
<i>The will</i>!  I now thought of the important part I had
played in secret, concerning that remarkable document, and
all the pulses of my heart beat quicker, when I beheld
Messieurs Quirky and Macfarisee ascend the steps of
the portico, and re-enter the dining-room, whither they
desired me to bring up the green bag, and remain beside
them.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Rose was again leaning against the marble mantel-piece,
with nearly the same soldierly air of indifference as before.
He had seen so much of stirring life and military
service&mdash;withal, he was so <i>blasé</i> and thoroughly used up&mdash;that
nothing now could interest him much.  The faces of a few
distant relations, or connections, or friends (I know not
which they were) who were present, were now less solemn
than before; a species of rubicon had been passed; the
interment&mdash;a disagreeable prelude&mdash;had been got over;
they were now appetised for dinner, and partook freely of
the wines at a side-table, looking from time to time at
Messrs. Quirky and Macfarisee, who were whispering together,
and fumbling, somewhat nervously and ostentatiously,
after certain real or imaginary documents, in the depth of the
aforesaid green bag.
</p>

<p>
"My sister-in-law left a will, I think you said, gentlemen?"
observed Colonel Rose.
</p>

<p>
"So she told me, my dear colonel&mdash;so she told me,"
replied Mr. Quirky, with his professional smile.
</p>

<p>
"Told you, sir.  Did you not prepare it in due and legal
form?" asked the colonel sharply.
</p>

<p>
"No.  It was, I understood her to say, a holograph
testament of the mode in which she wished her worldly
possessions&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"The dross of this life, as she truly termed them,"
interrupted Macfarisee.
</p>

<p>
"Disposed of, and to whom?"
</p>

<p>
"Exactly so.  Ah, my dear colonel, she walked through
this vale of tears with an upright step.  Blessed are the
dead, who die as she died."
</p>

<p>
"Well, but the will, Mr. Macfarisee," said the colonel
impatiently.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing now remains but to read the last melancholy
wishes of our deceased sister in the spirit."
</p>

<p>
"But where the deuce are they expressed?"
</p>

<p>
"In a document, committed, I believe, to the custody of
Miss Amy Lee."
</p>

<p>
"I have a sealed paper which you gave me, sir, some
weeks ago," said Amy, rising timidly from her seat.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;by your aunt's express order," said Mr. Quirky,
hurriedly; "it is her will&mdash;will you please to produce it?"
</p>

<p>
Amy hastened to her desk, opened it, and presented the
sealed packet to Macfarisee.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, my dear child&mdash;compose yourself and be
seated; there&mdash;that will do.  Ah me! ah me! such a day
of trial this has been for us all!"
</p>

<p>
Macfarisee tried to look more solemn than ever, and
thrice wiped his gold spectacles, as if his emotion had
dimmed them.  I saw him tremble visibly, as he broke the
large red seal which bore Mrs. Rose's coat of arms in a
widow's lozenge, and drew forth the contents, which he
believed were to transfer Applewood, and all within and
upon it, to him and his heirs for ever.  On unfolding it, he
started&mdash;changed colour, and his stealthy eyes dilated and
filled with a baleful gleam.  He looked under, over, and
through his spectacles.  He turned the paper round, and
viewed it in every way with a bewildered or astounded air.
</p>

<p>
It was totally <i>blank</i>!
</p>

<p>
He grew absolutely peagreen, and muttered something
like a malediction deeply and huskily under his breath; he
then examined the envelope, to see if his initials were still
above the seal, where in a moment of cunning and sudden
suspicion he had written them.  The cover had evidently
never been broken before; then where was the will?&mdash;or
how was a sheet of blank paper substituted for it?  He
glanced at Amy&mdash;he glared at me; the perspiration started
in white bead-drops on his mean and contracted brow, and
he looked around him, with such an aspect of bewilderment,
that Colonel Rose exclaimed,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Hollo, sir,&mdash;what the devil is the matter?"
</p>

<p>
"Matter, sir&mdash;matter&mdash;why, a felony has been committed
here."
</p>

<p>
"Felony?" reiterated the colonel, now thoroughly
roused, and in a voice of thunder, which brought all the
hungry expectants to their feet; "what the deuce do you
mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Can this be a <i>deceptio visus</i>?" groaned Macfarisee.
</p>

<p>
"It is no visual deception," said the sharp voice of
Mr. Quirky, as he came to the aid of his bewildered legal
brother; "for this envelope once contained the last will
and testament of our deceased friend&mdash;a document to which
I was a witness, and it must have been abstracted or
destroyed."
</p>

<p>
"S'death! who in this house would be guilty of such an
act?" demanded Colonel Rose, reddening with anger, and
drawing up his soldier-like figure to its full height.
</p>

<p>
"She has destroyed the will," whined Macfarisee, who
was now ashy pale with rage and disappointed avarice, and
trembled in every limb.
</p>

<p>
"She&mdash;who&mdash;mean you my sister-in-law?"
</p>

<p>
"No, colonel; <i>she</i> was all saintly purity, and covered by
it as by a shining garment."
</p>

<p>
"I will thank you, sir, to come to a halt with this
miserable cant," said Colonel Rose contemptuously; "say
who then?"
</p>

<p>
"Miss Amy Lee."
</p>

<p>
"Amy Lee?&mdash;Impossible; fellow, you rave!"
</p>

<p>
"Into her custody I gave it; she whom her good aunt
reared in the paths of rectitude, deeming her a lamb rescued
from the slaughter, a brand snatched from the burning; but
Satan is in her heart,&mdash;she has destroyed the will, and
ruined her own soul!"
</p>

<p>
Overwhelmed by this strange and sudden accusation,
poor Amy's first outburst of pride and ladylike indignation
gave way to softness and a torrent of tears; while the
defeated Macfarisee trod hastily to and fro, muttering with
his thin lips,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"She has destroyed it,&mdash;destroyed a legal document&mdash;committed
a felony,&mdash;tempted&mdash;tempted by&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"By whom, sir?" demanded Colonel Rose, while sternly
confronting him; "be explicit, sir, or by Heaven, I'll
knock you down.  By whom?"
</p>

<p>
"The devil, who is ever walking abroad, seeking whom
he may devour."
</p>

<p>
"Had you mentioned anyone else, sir, by Jove, I would
have shied you over that window into the shrubbery.  But
now, Mr. Nathaniel Macfarisee, as we have had enough of
this most unusual and unseemly scene, and as you and your
partner allege you both saw this missing document, perhaps
you will have the goodness to state, to the best of your
recollection, the tenor of it?"
</p>

<p>
"I beg leave to decline affording any information anent
it, unless when examined on oath, before a justice of the
peace," said Quirky, sullenly and impertinently; for he was
cunning as a magpie.
</p>

<p>
"And I also decline to do so, even then, as oaths are
against my conscience," added Macfarisee, "the Scripture
saith, 'swear not,' and I will not swear."
</p>

<p>
The most minute search failed to discover among the
repositories of the deceased the least scrap of paper, in any way
resembling a will, holograph or otherwise; and ultimately,
Messrs. Quirky and Macfarisee were obliged to retire from
Applewood, without beat of drum, leaving Amy Lee the
sole and acknowledged heiress of the late proprietress; and
very haughtily and coldly the colonel bade them farewell, as
they stepped into one of the mourning coaches, and for
greater freedom of surmise and conversation, no doubt,
desired me to "mount beside the driver."  We were driven
back to town just as the snow-flakes began to fall drearily
aslant the dark-grey northern sky, upon the gloomy thickets
and silent hills.  I remember that I was without a greatcoat;
but I did not feel cold, for my heart danced with joy
at the reflection of how I had outwitted two of the sharpest
lawyers that ever pocketted a fee.

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br><br>
MAHOGANY <i>v.</i> LAW
</h3>

<p>
For some time after this event, Macfarisee was sullen as
a Greenland bear, and we heard very little scripture quoted.
Indeed, I am uncertain whether I did not hear him mutter
a pretty distinct "d&mdash;n" on one or two occasions.
</p>

<p>
I saw Amy at intervals, though the wintry weather and
ten miles of snow-covered country that lay between us were
serious barriers to frequent meetings.  Moreover, the colonel's
residence at Applewood had changed the tenor of life and
society there.  Mr. Jedediah Pawkie and the godly elders
of his synagogue were banished therefrom with very little
ceremony, and the aspect of the colonel's Malay servant
seemed, as the incarnation of sin, to suggest very unpleasant
ideas to their minds.  The country at this time was
swarming with troops, as an invasion was expected from
France.  Horse, foot, artillery, line, fencibles, and militia
(to say nothing of volunteers), were quartered everywhere,
and, as a regiment of remarkably smart light infantry (the
old 43rd, I think) occupied a temporary wooden barrack at
the village of Applewood, the house and lawn became the
daily resort and lounge of the officers, to whom the colonel's
full-bodied old port and the billiard-room proved very
acceptable.
</p>

<p>
I trembled for my influence over Amy; yet I never
hinted, even in the most distant manner, as to whose mistake
she was indebted for becoming the heiress of her aunt.
Indeed, much as I boyishly loved this girl, and brilliant
though her prospects, I had soon other things given me to
think of.
</p>

<p>
About this time, I remember there occurred a terrible
episode, which seriously affected the health of my mother,
and of Lotty too.  A travelling pedlar, one of those
itinerant jewellers, who were much more numerous in those
years than in the present, made his appearance at our
cottage one day, and opening his pack or box on the sill of
the window, at which my mother was seated, reading,
insisted on displaying his store of gold and silver watches,
rings, bracelets, baubles, and thimbles; and offered to buy
old metals, to barter or exchange, with all that pertinacity
peculiar to his craft.  Though very pressing, he loudly
repudiated the most remote idea of wishing for profit on
any transaction.  He had also some antiques, and little
Indian curiosities, which my mother was examining with
some interest, when suddenly her eyes dilated, and she
uttered a cry, between a shriek and a moan,&mdash;a terrible cry,
which seems yet, at times, to ring in my ears, and which
made the startled pedlar spring nearly a yard high, and spill
half his stock upon the parlour floor.  Among the articles
which he termed his curiosities, her eye had detected a little
round plate of silver, to which a thin fragment of bone was
attached, and on it was engraved, "Oliver Ellis, Captain,
21st Fusiliers."
</p>

<p>
It was the plate with which my father's head had been
trepanned, after the storming of the fort at Skenesborough, and
whereon, as I have mentioned elsewhere, he had fancifully
had his name, rank, and the number of his regiment,
engraved.  On seeing this affecting and terrible memento, the
poor old lady fainted, and the pedlar, in great alarm, bundled
up his wares and departed with precipitation&mdash;for his dealings
were not always on the side of honesty, and, not knowing
what manner of scrape he had fallen into, he left the village,
and long before my mother recovered was gone beyond recall.
</p>

<p>
With the knowledge that her husband was buried in his
soldier's grave, far, far away, on the bank of the mighty
Hudson, where the kind hands of dear comrades had heaped
the green sods over him, she had learned to be content and
resigned to her bereavement, as the fortune of war and the
will of God; but now, with this new knowledge that his
last resting-place had been violated,&mdash;when, or by whom, or
under what circumstances, she could never learn,&mdash;made her
wretched indeed!  A high fever was the result, and a long
illness, from which she was saved with the utmost difficulty.
Of the devil of a pedlar who caused all this evil, we
could never discover the slightest trace.  He had come
and gone like the "Sandman" of the German romance,
or that unpleasantly ubiquitous personage, with whom
our friend Dr. Twaddel, wrestled in the spirit, every
Sunday.
</p>

<p>
While my mind was occupied by this affair, the thoughts
of the worthy Mr. Macfarisee were ever running on the
missing will.  I know not whether he connected me with its
disappearance, but he was now more exacting, more annoying,
and more pettily tyrannical than ever, and his concealed
wrath hovered over my devoted head, like the sword that
erst hung by a horse's hair above the pericranium of
Damocles.  One day, I was alone in Macfarisee's
business-room, when happening to open a book near to me, the
following passage struck my eye:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Why should I wear out a dreary life in poverty and
obscurity, while I loathe one and detest the other?  There
are, who talk of calm content, of gliding unnoticed through
the road of life: let those who like such ignoble path
follow it.  Did I make myself?  Did I wish to enter on
this mortal struggle?  Did I give myself feelings, ideas, or
wishes?  My future rests upon my belief, as if I could
believe what I chose."
</p>

<p>
These questions filled me with strange thoughts, and I
sank into one of my day-dreams, from which I was roused
by the unwelcome entrance of Macfarisee.  Perceiving that
no other person was present, he began, in an unusually bland
tone of voice, to refer to the scene that took place at
Applewood on the day of the funeral, adding,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"There is something very mysterious, Oliver Ellis, in the
disappearance of that document!"
</p>

<p>
"So I have heard you say, sir, many times."
</p>

<p>
"Ay,&mdash;but there is something more than mysterious,
and to that I have a clue," said he, impressively, while his
stealthy eyes seemed to glare into mine, and I could not
repress an emotion of discomfort and alarm.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed!" I exclaimed; "but in whatever way Mrs. Rose
penned her will, she may have changed her mind
before death."
</p>

<p>
"No, I do not think so; she was a woman who walked
in the way of the Lord, and now dwells in peace for ever.
She meant that all she possessed should become the inheritance
of His servants, for His glory and their <i>comfort</i>," said
he; and while canting thus, he ground his sharp teeth at
the thought of all that had escaped him.  "No, no,&mdash;she
knew who was her light and her salvation."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean the Reverend Mr. Pawkie?" I asked,
innocently.
</p>

<p>
"Listen to me," said he; "you have been at Applewood
frequently and unknown to <i>me</i>,&mdash;unknown for a time, at
least.  You have seen Miss Amy Lee in the woods and in
the park&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I have been watched&mdash;followed!" I began, with a
sudden glow of rage and just indignation, as I instantly saw
some of the meaner clerks of the firm having been guilty of
this act of espionage.
</p>

<p>
"<i>How</i> I came to know this, matters not&mdash;you do not
deny the fact?"
</p>

<p>
"Most certainly I do not," said I; "and what then?"
</p>

<p>
"Simply this, my dear, deluded boy," he replied, pressing
my arm with his long, lean, ugly fingers, while his sharp
visage was lighted by such a smile as sin might wear on the
threshold of hell; "I know that Miss Amy burned her
aunt's will, lest overmuch of her earthly inheritance might
go to the faithful servants of the Lord, and those who twice
yearly serve at His tabernacle.  I <i>know</i> that she <i>burned</i> the
will, and that <i>you</i> were present when she did so.  We have
pretty ample proofs of the place, time, and circumstances;
and if you will give me a holograph statement to this
effect&mdash;a statement supposed to be written under emotions of
remorse&mdash;I will give you a present of fifty guineas just now,
and one hundred more after.  I know, my dear young
friend, that you are not like those of whom Paul wrote to
Timothy, as 'given to wine, a striker, or greedy of filthy
lucre, but patient and not covetous;' and through you I
would seek the means of punishing this girl, to lead her, by
chastisement, from the snares of the devil, who hath taken
her captive&mdash;and from the life of sin and pleasure she leads,
being, as the blessed scripture truly saith, really dead
while she liveth.  Do you understand me, my dear young
man?"
</p>

<p>
I stood for a full minute in silence; for this ill-judged
and barefaced combination of hypocrisy and temptation to
crime filled me with such rage and confusion, that I knew
not what to reply.
</p>

<p>
"Sir!" I stammered.
</p>

<p>
"Reflect on all my good friend has urged, Mr. Ellis,"
said Quirky, appearing suddenly behind me.
</p>

<p>
"I <i>have</i> reflected," said I, in a breathless voice, while
playing nervously with a mahogany ruler&mdash;a pretty heavy
one too.
</p>

<p>
"Then pen us the required statement&mdash;that you saw the
girl, Amy Lee, burn her aunt's will?"
</p>

<p>
"But I never witnessed any such act," I replied.  While
panting with rage, I spoke slowly to gather time for
thought and action.  "I repeat, sir, that I never beheld
any such deed!"
</p>

<p>
"But you <i>might</i> have seen it," said Macfarisee, suavely,
and with a grimace which he meant to be excessively
conciliating; "you might, my dear boy, and such a statement
from you is necessary to complete a plan we have in view,
to enforce the ends of justice and law, which are the same;
for as the holy apostle saith, 'Law is good, if a man use it
<i>lawfully</i>,' First Timothy, chapter first, hey-ho-hum!"
</p>

<p>
"What motive have you in view?"
</p>

<p>
"What the deuce have you, or such as you, to do with
the motives or morals of those who employ you?" demanded
Quirky, whose natural insolence for the moment got entirely
the better of his prudence.
</p>

<p>
"Sir, sir,&mdash;I am a gentleman!"
</p>

<p>
"A <i>gentleman</i>&mdash;God help us! a fine gentleman, to whom
we pay thirty pounds per annum."
</p>

<p>
"If I am not, my father was at least a gentleman," said
I, almost choking with the conflict of suppressed emotions;
"he was an officer, who died in action&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"If he had been a thief who died on the gallows, it were
all the same to me," replied the legal bully; "I want neither
gentlemen, nor their sons, in my office.  I want only my
orders obeyed; my work, my business done.  I want&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Stay, Mr. Quirky; do stop, pray," interposed Macfarisee,
with an air of solemnity and alarm.  "This outbreak
is useless; if one hundred and fifty guineas&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Will not tempt me, the hard words and gratuitous insolence
of an underbred villain are less likely to do so," I
exclaimed; and by one blow of the ponderous ruler stretched
Mr. Quirky bleeding and senseless at my feet.  Then a
flame seemed to pass before my eyes, a shock like electricity
ran over every fibre, and feeling my heart grow wild with
rage and excitement, I sprang upon the excited Macfarisee
just as he was rushing to the bellrope.  Grasping his white
neckcloth by one hand, I showered my blows upon his bald
caput and shoulders with the other, until, in reeling
backward, he stumbled over Quirky, and falling heavily against
a writing-table, lay still as if dead.  A wilder spirit of
mischief and destruction was now added to my long-pent-up
hatred; and with the mischief of a boy, or of an enraged
monkey, I snatched sundry bundles of papers, tore some to
pieces, heaped others on the fire, spilled the contents of a
large inkbottle over everything, threw down the tables and
chairs, and with an <i>io pæan</i> of triumph, rushed from the
the field of battle, flourishing my ruler like the truncheon of
a conqueror.
</p>

<p>
Just as I sprang down stairs into the street, taking three
steps at a time, a window was opened overhead, and I heard
the shrill voice of Macfarisee shouting,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"The guard! the guard!"
</p>

<p>
There were no police, and this was the usual cry when
the soldiers of the city watch were required.  The evening
was dusk now, and I ran through the thoroughfares
bare-headed and grasping tightly my weapon&mdash;for my blood was
yet up, and I would without shrinking have faced all the
charged bayonets of the city guard; but I ran on&mdash;on&mdash;I
knew not, and cared not whither.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br><br>
EDINBURGH IN 1792.
</h3>

<p>
The house from which I had just issued stood nearly opposite
to the old Tolbooth, or Heart of Midlothian, which was
built almost in the centre of the High Street, and in the
lower story thereof were nightly lodged a lieutenant with a
party of the ancient city guard.  The cries of Macfarisee
readily reached the sentinel at the door, and he turned out
the watch.  Armed with fixed bayonets and Lochaber axes,
they issued forth in pursuit; but I fled before them like an
arrow and darted down the Lord President's Stairs, which, I
knew communicated with the Fishmarket Close, and the
entrance to which was in a great tenement on the eastern
side of the Parliament-square&mdash;all since removed and
numbered with the things that were.  I plunged breathlessly down
the steep Close, cries of "The guard! the guard! to the
Tolbooth with him," following me, for these shouts, though
uttered heedlessly by those I passed, were additional
incentives to flight; and panting with rage and fear, I sped on,
while I could hear the guardsmen swearing in Gaelic behind
me.  I could also hear the clank of their terrible Lochaber
axes, which were furnished with sharp hooks, wherewith to
catch fugitives, or to drag the refractory, and I could see the
dim glimmer of their large horn lanterns, as I crossed the
narrow Cowgate and rushed up the steep College Wynd
towards a gate in the town wall known as the Potter How
Porte.  Here stood a sentinel, who put his axe before me
and demanded sixpence for allowing me to pass.  I pretended
to search my pockets, wherein I had not a stiver; and while
thus throwing him off his guard, darted through the barrier,
and, with a shout of triumph, rushed into the darkness
beyond.  My first impulse was to run into the country,
and take refuge in the village where my mother's cottage
stood; but a fear lest Macfarisee might send the guards
there first, deterred me; and hastening to the Meadows,
which lie southward of the city, and were then, as now, a
lonely and sequestered place, rendered unwholesome by
swamps, being the bed of an ancient lake, and dangerous as
the haunt of armed footpads, robbers, and outcasts.  I had
nothing to lose but my liberty, and they were not likely to
deprive me of that.
</p>

<p>
In those meadows are a few stone seats placed at intervals
under the trees.  On one of these I seated myself, and
began to reflect on the situation of my affairs.  Though
moonless, the sky was clear, and the night was warm and
pleasant.  The intense solitude of the place contrasted with
the recent fiery turmoil of my own thoughts.  I felt for a
time all the visionary independence of youth: I had left,
as it were, all my fetters behind me; but there were my
mother, little Lotty, and Amy Lee!  How sore, and sad,
and bitter, the thoughts of them made my aching heart!
The bloody gash on the head of Quirky, and the malevolent
smile of Macfarisee, seemed to haunt me amid the
darkness, and vague fears came over me.
</p>

<p>
I thought of how gladly I would work hard, even for a
pittance, if well treated; I thought of my own friendlessness,
and of all I had endured at the hands of these sanctimonious
knaves&mdash;these legal parvenus&mdash;but my fury had passed
away, and I felt it would have been a relief to my soul,
could I have wept bitterly.
</p>

<p>
The low-muttered voices of a number of men approaching
now fell upon my ear.  I thought immediately of the guard,
and seeking a more sequestered place, climbed up a beech
tree, amid the thick foliage of which I deemed myself
perfectly secure.  I had not been perched there three minutes,
when, to my terror, I heard voices on all sides of me, and
beheld numbers of men coming straight towards the place of
my concealment.  There was a tingling sensation in my ears,
and my breath came thick and fast; while, as if they had
sprung from the swampy turf, in an incredibly short space
of time, the beech tree was environed by a mob of more
than a thousand men, many of whom were armed, as I
could perceive swords, pikes, and muskets among them.
A torch was now lighted, and its wavering gleam fell redly
on their faces&mdash;the grim and dirty faces of an excited and
unwashed multitude&mdash;as, amid cries of "Robert Watt&mdash;Robert
Watt&mdash;hurrah!" they were all turned to one point,
where an orator or leader, who was elevated on the shoulders
of four men, proceeded to harangue them in a subdued but
determined tone of voice.
</p>

<p>
He was a pale, sallow-visaged and sad-eyed young man,
who in no way suggested the idea of a patriot or hero.
</p>

<p>
My anxiety now increased to agony, when I found myself
compelled to act the spy upon a band of these desperate
men, who, at that period, styled themselves the "Friends of
the People"&mdash;a small but desperate section, who were
instigated to revolt against all monarchical government, and who
had corresponding societies in all parts of Great Britain&mdash;men
whose avowed object was to reform a very defective
parliamentary representation, while, ultimately, they aimed
at the seizure of the Castle of Edinburgh, the plunder of
the banks and government offices, and the capture, if not the
murder, of all the senators of the College of Justice, and
other heads of departments, civil, military, and religious.
</p>

<p>
If discovered by these worthies on my perch in the tree,
I had little doubt they would have shot me like a sparrow,
and perhaps buried me on the ground where they stood to
silence my tongue for ever.  I scarcely dared to breathe.  I
thought of my mother, and imagined her sensations, if I
were found there murdered, or if I disappeared for ever, like
a bubble on a stream, and, like many other honest persons,
was moved to tears, by the prospect of my own untimely
demise.  Meanwhile the mass below me swayed to and fro;
the torches continued to sputter and gleam, and the orator to
spout treason, fire and sword against all crowned heads,
especially "the old tyrant who dwelt in the castle of
Windsor;" liberty, equality, fraternity&mdash;the rights of
men&mdash;oppression, chains and slavery&mdash;kings and tyrants, were
the staple subjects of his inflammatory discourse, until he
mentioned the slave trade and borough reform, in connection
with the name of Henry Dundas, the city member,
when a yell of hatred broke from the multitude, with
cries of,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"To the lamp-post with him!"
</p>

<p>
"Up with the barricades!"
</p>

<p>
"Down with the three estates&mdash;kings, lords, and clergy!"
</p>

<p>
Then this strange band, after giving three cheers for Tom
Paine and Robert Watt, passed a unanimous resolution to
burn the Tory M.P. in effigy on the next day, the 4th of
June, the anniversary of George the Third's birth.  They
uprooted some hundred yards of paling for staves to arm
them with; the torch was extinguished; the orator
descended from his perch; in a few minutes they had all
disappeared, and the wooded parks became voiceless and silent
as before.
</p>

<p>
This leader was that unfortunate Robert Watt, who, on
the 15th of the succeeding October (for the very same
opinions which he there expressed so freely) was drawn on
a low hurdle, heavily chained, to the Castle Hill of
Edinburgh, and had his head struck from his body by three
blows of an axe, pursuant to a sentence passed on him by
the Lord Justice General of Scotland.
</p>

<p>
I drew a long breath when they separated, deeming that
I had narrowly escaped a sudden death.  Still I was afraid
to leave my retreat altogether; so descending from the
beech, I sought a place where the grass was soft and dry at
the root of an old oak tree, and lay down to think over my
situation, and the truths I had heard&mdash;for much that was
solemn, and stern truth had fallen from the lips of Robert
Watt.  I had ample food for reflection, but amid it I fell
into a sound and heavy sleep.
</p>

<p>
In the year of which I write&mdash;to wit, 1792&mdash;the Scottish
capital had made but little progress (as we now understand
that great and comprehensive word) since the commencement
of the century, save in noisy professions of religion,
and an external air of sanctity to cloak hypocrisy and vice.
</p>

<p>
Though a new town on the north, and another on the
south, were rising into existence, the mass of the citizens
dwelt yet within the steep, narrow closes and wynds of the
ancient city, from which many made vows they would never
remove.  The streets were without sewerage, and dimly
lighted by a few oil-lamps, which were placed on wooden
posts at long intervals.  People dined at two o'clock, and
were all a-bed by eleven.  The High Street alone was well
watched.  There, the city guard, a body of three hundred
old soldiers, who wore the square-skirted red coats and
cocked hats of Queen Anne's time, and were armed with the
long muskets and bayonets, and the Lochaber axes used by
Scottish regiments in her wars, were the custodiers of the
public safety.  Being all Highlanders, they spoke no
language save the Celtic, and were alternately the jest and the
terror of the people.  Women were still flogged at a
cart's-tail, or drummed through the streets for petty offences,
and poor debtors begged for alms at the door of St. Giles',
as they had done in the days of the Jameses.
</p>

<p>
Though the capital was little changed in its <i>external</i>
aspect, the hearty old Scottish spirit was dead, or dying fast;
and so narrow-minded were the people, that a few years
before, a clergyman had to strip off his gown and turn soldier,
for having penned a tragedy, which now ranks as one of the
British Classics.  I allude to Home, the author of "Douglas."
Any one who entered a theatre, especially on a Saturday;
or read a novel, especially on a Sunday; or who, on that grim
Scottish day of silence or psalmsinging, ventured to
whistle or hum an air, received public censure; for now it
seemed as if fasting and preaching, hypocrisy and craft, were
all to flourish together, each bearing a due proportion to
the progress of the other.  Thus choked amid such evil weeds,
nothing truly good, or great, or pure, can thrive or be
attempted, without exciting the envy of some, or the
contumely of others; for many men are there, who would
oppose even the redemption of mankind, if to do so suited
the advancement of their vulgarly-sectarian, selfishly-political,
or personal interests&mdash;and so, as Macfarisee would
say, "the wicked flourished like the green bay tree."  So
still the tide rolls on&mdash;religion becoming a surly
burlesque&mdash;society a system of miserable cliques, and the nation
itself a provincial tradition.
</p>

<p>
In 1792 the ideas of the people were so contracted and
thoroughly local, that the appearance of a strange carriage
in the streets put all Edinburgh a-tiptoe for three days to
discover its owner&mdash;and so low had the old military spirit
sunk, that the appearance of the pirate Paul Jones in the
river, in 1779, threw eighty thousand citizens into a
paroxysm of terror.
</p>

<p>
Few persons left, and fewer still visited, Edinburgh in
those days.  Any one departing thence for London&mdash;perhaps
the great and only event of a long stupid and
monotonous life&mdash;cautiously settled his worldly affairs by
will, was duly prayed for in "the kirk"&mdash;took solemn leave
of his weeping relations, and was escorted by all his friends
to the eastern gate of the town; and all were there again
to receive and conduct him with acclamations to his home
in some dingy close of the middle ages, when he returned
three months after, by the well-armed stage-coach, "General
Wolfe" or the letter-of-marque smack, "The Lovely Jenny,"
carrying four 6-pounders&mdash;and brimful of hair-breadth
escapes from footpads and masked highwaymen, to be
related, amid due libations of reeking whiskey toddy, to a
gaping circle of provincials.
</p>

<p>
By the spread of education among the lower, and the
almost general flight of the upper classes, the old order of
society became inverted.  Dukes and earls no longer lived
in the Canongate; nor lords, nor lairds, nor aristocratic
grandmothers, who remembered "the bonnie prince" dancing
in Holyrood, or the cannon that boomed for his downfall
at Culloden; nothing now remained to Scotland, but the
dregs and lees of her once warlike and kingly post&mdash;the
sour kirk and the subtle law.
</p>

<p>
So matters had been going on for years, and all had been
quiet in the Scottish capital since the terrible Porteous mob
of 1735, and the irruption of the Clans ten years later, until
this year, 1792, when the political convulsions in France
began to affect their well-wishers in Scotland, a country so
long neglected by a foreign race of kings and an alien
peerage, as to have lost all sympathy for either; thus the
sentiments of republicanism spread like a contagion among
certain classes, who began to arm them in secret&mdash;to form
clubs, on the principle of those over which Marat and others
presided in Paris, and to designate themselves, "The Friends
of the People."

<h3>
CHAPTER XII.
<br><br>
THE FRIENDS OF THE PEOPLE.
</h3>

<p>
The morning of the 4th of June dawned in all the beauty
of the month.  The day came in brilliantly and clear; but
the idea pressed heavily on my heart that, for the <i>first</i> time
in my life, I had been absent a whole night from my
mother's roof; and what would be her thoughts&mdash;what
might her terrors be?  The foliage of the old trees was
waving on the wind.  From the flat green meadows a gauze-like
haze was exhaled by the sun, in whose beams, the myriad
windows of the city and the clocks of its churches were glittering
as if illuminated for a festival.  The wild flowers which
grew by those pools of water which formed the last remnants
of the ancient Burghloch, and in which the black coot
and the little teal duck swam, were waving their cups and
petals to and fro, as the honey bees crept into them; and
the mavis and merle sang merrily above the pale-green
billows of the ripening corn that grew on the slopes
beyond.
</p>

<p>
I felt all the beauty of the summer morning; but I was
also sensible of being chill and stiffened by the effects of a
night passed in the open air.  I thought of Amy Lee&mdash;of
Applewood; and then something of a glow came over my
wayward heart on reflecting that I was free&mdash;free by the
act that made me so; yet, withal, I was anxious&mdash;restless&mdash;unhappy.
How little could I foresee all that was before
me!
</p>

<p>
As the morning bells began to toll, there came a hum
from the rousing city.  All the boys within its walls were
busy; for on this great holiday many thousand tiny
cannons, with many a musket and pistol, were incessantly
exploding, bonfires were blazing everywhere, all the
lamp-posts were decorated with green boughs, the statues of
Charles II. and George Heriot were crowned with laurel
and covered with flowers.  According to immemorial custom,
the Lord Provost was to entertain the local notorieties of
Edinburgh with sweetmeats and wine in the stately old
Parliament House, in front of which the three hundred
bayonets of the city guard were under arms to fire a rattling
volley between every toast, while the bells rang joyously,
and the cannon of the castle shook the tall mansions of the
ancient city, as they boomed over her echoing hills, in honour
of the good old king's birthday.
</p>

<p>
On this 4th of June there were many who held aloof
from all this hearty old loyalty&mdash;many who whispered
together in archways and narrow alleys&mdash;in taverns and at
street corners, and who muttered under their breath.
</p>

<p>
These were the Friends of the People, and the foes of
kings, of peers, and prelates.
</p>

<p>
On this occasion the magistrates anticipated various
disturbances, notwithstanding the loud manifestations of
loyalty, and had taken the precaution of bringing a few
troops of the 2nd Dragoon Guards into the city.  Threatening
letters had been addressed to the provost, and placards
of a seditious nature had been strewed overnight in the
streets.  The remains of others were still fluttering on the
walls where the officials of the city had defaced them.  The
minds of the people and of the soldiers became inflamed
against each other; for the whole conduct of the magistrates
had been, as usual on such occasions, most unwise.
</p>

<p>
Afraid to go home, lest my present <i>bête noir</i> Macfarisee
might have sent some of the city guard there to inquire after
me, I slipped into the city with a few country folks who were
proceeding to market, and water-carriers, who with their
slung barrels were plodding to the public wells.  Then I
saw by the proclamations which were everywhere posted
up, by the sentinels of the city guard being doubled on
all the banks, the Parliament House, and other public
buildings, that a riot was expected; and in confirmation
thereof, three troops of heavy cavalry rode in sections up the
High Street at an easy trot, with their swords glittering,
their powdered hair seeming all white as new-fallen snow,
and their long queues hanging straight down to the back-buttons
of their square-tailed red coats; while the kettle-drums
beat, and their brass trumpets, from each of which a
royal standard hung, blew sharply defiance to the people,
who, no way daunted by their splendid aspect or the
gigantic cocked-hats then worn by the Guards, hooted
loudly, and threw squibs and fireworks among them.
</p>

<p>
"No dragoons! no military tyranny!" cried some.
</p>

<p>
"Off&mdash;off! down with the Tory Provost!" cried others.
</p>

<p>
"Johnnie Cope!  Johnnie Cope! be off to Preston Pans!"
This was to taunt the cavalry, whom the people knew
represented the regiment of Sir John Cope.  The dragoons
retorted, and greatly irritated their tormentors, "by
cursing them for Scotch rebels!" as the <i>Intelligencer</i> relates.
I had no money; but curiosity to see what might ensue
prevented me from feeling hungry at the time, so morning
soon passed into noon.
</p>

<p>
The 2nd Dragoon Guards formed line across the broad
High Street, cutting off all communication between the
upper and lower parts of it, and thus causing a great crowd
to assemble; a few of these were petulant and clamorous,
but by far the greater number were merely sullen spectators.
Amid the excitement consequent to the ringing of bells, the
huzzahs that came through the tall gothic windows of
the ancient Parliament House, the rattle of the drums that
were placed in its lobby, and the volleys of the city guard,
who, with all their officers in full uniform, with epaulette,
sash and gorget, were formed in line across the square, where
they fired a <i>feu-de-joie</i> between every toast given at the
Provost's <i>déjeuner</i>, various scuffles took place.  A drunken
tailor fell among the troop-horses, and was nearly trampled
to death by one.  He was quickly dragged forth by the
fast-gathering populace, who immediately assailed the
unfortunate rider by a storm of squibs, rockets, stones, and
abuse.  This so greatly exasperated the trooper, that on
seeing a milkman, named William Tule, attempting to
force a passage through the ranks, he made a downward cut
at him with his sword, and I saw the man's left cheek shred
off, like a slice from a water-melon.
</p>

<p>
The yells, hootings, cries and rage of the mob in front,
who, as usual, were urged on by those who were behind,
and who were too artful to make themselves prominent,
now knew no bounds.  Many, armed with staves and
shovels, now began to appear as if by magic.  I saw one
or two pikeheads glittering in the sunshine, and it became
evident that a dangerous collision was impending; for men's
blood was getting heated, though they scarcely knew why.
</p>

<p>
While the cavalry held their position at the cross, and a
vulgar and pompous group of startled magistrates, wearing
scarlet gowns, grotesque cocked-hats, gold chains, and other
mummery of office, were in conference with the major
commanding, that gallant officer got rapidly flushed (as no
less than six-and-thirty toasts had been quaffed that
morning at the civic <i>déjeuner</i>), and scarcely attended to the
remarks of the provost, who now asked his advice&mdash;then
entreated the mob to disperse, and anon threatened them
with the Riot Act, arrests, fire, and sword.  During this
scene in the Parliament Square, a great concourse emerged
from some of the closes further down, and debouching
upon the street, wheeled to the south, round the Tron church,
and passed rapidly along the South Bridge, cheering
vociferously.  I rushed away to see what this portended, and
soon found myself involved in the living surge, that
rolled towards the southern portion of the city.
</p>

<p>
At that moment, the report of two heavy cannon fired in
rapid succession pealed from the castle walls, through the
clear sunny air.
</p>

<p>
This was a signal, pre-arranged, to bring in a fresh force
of cavalry, and for the <i>Hythe</i> frigate and <i>Tartar</i> cutter,
which were lying off Leith, to land at once their seamen
and marines, for the magistrates of the city, at all times
famous for their mock servility to the powers that be,
were resolved to prevent, by every means in their power,
the atrocity&mdash;for so they termed it&mdash;of committing the
M.P.'s wretched image to the flames.
</p>

<p>
To me, the wild hubbub in which I found myself involved
was somewhat soothing.  It drew me from my own thoughts,
and, borne away by the excitement of the scene, I went
willingly on with the furious tide to see the end of this
affair, which soon assumed a perilous aspect.
</p>

<p>
I had a confused recollection of many of the grim, fierce,
and dirty visages of those around me, who now seemed most
noisy and active.  These were all armed with staves, and
were "the Friends of the People," who had assembled
in the meadows on the preceding evening.  Suddenly I
saw a human figure elevated above the sea of heads that
occupied the entire breadth of the street, amid shouts of,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"To a lamp-post&mdash;a rope, a rope!&mdash;to a lamp-post with
him!"
</p>

<p>
The fierce resolution, the coarse brutality, and utter
mercilessness of a Scottish mob are well known.  I trembled
when I saw this miserable wretch buoyed aloft above the sea
of human beings, like a cork upon the waves; but a roar of
laughter reassured me, and I soon perceived that what
excited my fear and sympathy was a ludicrous but carefully-made
effigy of the Tory member&mdash;an effigy in which nothing
of his resemblance was omitted&mdash;his ample shirt frill&mdash;his
white corded breeches and top-boots&mdash;his powdered wig,
and salmon-coloured coat with carved silver buttons.
</p>

<p>
Amid the groans and execrations of the multitude, this
dummy was duly hanged on a lamp-post, while the glass of
the adjacent windows was heard crashing in all directions.
A baker's shop was also sacked, and as the loaves and hot
rolls went in showers about the street, I caught one of the
latter and proceeded at once to breakfast.  For the first
time I discovered that if I was free&mdash;I was hungry.
</p>

<p>
The image was cut down, and nearly torn to pieces when
it fell.
</p>

<p>
Those qualities which have ever rendered a Scottish riot
most terrible, when the decision and cunning of some are
combined with the savagery of others, now began to exhibit
themselves in wanton assaults upon respectable citizens and
the destruction of property, as the still gathering rabble
swept on, with their image borne aloft, and poured, like a
living flood, into the wide and quiet arena of George Square,
filling the air with cries of,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Borough reform! borough reform!"
</p>

<p>
"Liberty, equality, and fraternity!"
</p>

<p>
"Down with the ministry!&mdash;down with the king!"
</p>

<p>
"Down with the provost!&mdash;he is an enemy to the people!"
</p>

<p>
For now these phrases, with those of "tyranny, oppression,
the rights of men and humanity," were uttered
glibly by all, while the secret manufacture of pikeheads and
cutlass blades evinced the ulterior views of those who
uttered them.
</p>

<p>
Such cries now loaded the air, and while the clatter of
breaking window-panes rang on every side, as the houses
of the square were assailed, and every lamp-post, door-step,
and iron railing became occupied by those who wished
to see the fun or outrage&mdash;and while all the upper windows
and skylights became filled by anxious and terrified
faces, the ringleaders, after totally demolishing the windows
of Lady Armiston's mansion, and those of Admiral Duncan
and the Lord Advocate&mdash;halted and proposed to burn the
effigy.  While the fire was being piled up and lighted, I
saw a tall old gentleman of great stature, and of a singularly
noble aspect, with long white hair, advance from one of
the houses, resolutely but unwisely, fearlessly, and alone.
He attempted to expostulate with the crowd, but in
vain&mdash;a yell of opprobrium greeted him&mdash;and the dress
he wore, a blue naval uniform, faced with white
and laced with gold, seemed only to excite the ire, rather
than the respect, of this degraded rabble.  Violent hands
were laid upon the old man, but towering up like a
stately Hercules, he thrust the assailants back resolutely, as
if he still stood upon the deck of the <i>Venerable</i>, for this
white-haired gentleman was the Viscount Duncan, the
conqueror of De Winter, the future hero of Camperdown, he
who shared with old Rodney the glory of Cape St. Vincent.
</p>

<p>
A few, less brutal than their compeers, forced the admiral
kindly into his own house, and shut the door; and then,
amid a shout that made the welkin ring, the effigy of his
kinsman, Henry Dundas, was committed to the flames.
</p>

<p>
While the materials of which it was composed&mdash;straw,
rags, pitch, rosin, and gunpowder&mdash;were all blazing merrily,
and the people were all whooping, dancing, and cheering
round it, there was a sudden cry&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"The soldiers&mdash;here come the soldiers!"
</p>

<p>
Scrambling up a lamp-post, I saw the glitter of arms in
the Bristo Porte, and a mass of red-coats approaching, as six
companies of the 53rd, or old Shropshire regiment, came
double-quick into the square, and forming line along its
northern face, loaded with ball, and all their bright steel
ramrods flashed in the sunshine, as they were whirled round
and sent home.  Then the muskets were "cast about," and
the line stood still.
</p>

<p>
My heart beat ten pulsations in a second, and my breath
came thick and heavy.  I knew not what was about to ensue;
but clinging to my lofty perch, the iron loop of a lamp, I
remained, by a species of fascination, gazing at the long line
of infantry, standing firm, quiet and motionless as a brick
wall, in their coolness and perfect order, presenting a
powerful contrast to the clamorous and tumultuary multitude, that
surged, and swayed, and howled before them.
</p>

<p>
"They will never hurt <i>me</i>, at all events," thought I,
and I had a moral confidence in this.
</p>

<p>
Still unawed, the mob continued their assaults and
insults; the crash of windows went on; iron railings were
menaced next; then stones and other missiles were showered
like hail upon the unoffending 53rd, who long endured this
state of matters, with the patience and prudence which are
so characteristic of British soldiers.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly two words of command rang in the air.
</p>

<p>
"Ready&mdash;present!" there was a flash in the sunlight, as
the long line of bright barrels were levelled directly at
the mob.
</p>

<p>
"Fire!" added the officer in command.  There was a
sudden line of smoke, streaked with red flame&mdash;a mighty
rushing sound, as a sheet of lead tore through the air,
flattening out in starry spots on the stone walls, crashing
among the shrubbery of the gardens, breaking the iron rails,
and seeking human lives among the people, who wavered,
shrunk, and fled <i>en masse</i> in all directions, leaving twelve of
their number bleeding on the ground.
</p>

<p>
One column fled through Windmill Street, towards the
east; another by Buccleugh Street, towards the south; and
a third rushed by the meadows and Bruntsfield Links,
towards the west; but I observed that those mouthing
patriots, "the Friends of the People," a few of whom were
foolhardy enough to display tricolour cockades, were among
the first to fly.
</p>

<p>
Three men were killed and nine wounded, two of the
latter mortally.  One was a young lad named Ritchie, a
carver and gilder, the sole support of an aged mother; he
had been drawn there, like myself, in mere curiosity.
Another (a very old man) was found dead, with a ball in
his body, near the Castle Rock, next day.  As the soldiers,
in mercy to the people, levelled high, several persons were
wounded at the windows; and a French emigrant of high
rank received a ball in the head, just as he drew back the
curtain to peep out.
</p>

<p>
I felt the bullets whistle past me.  One actually grazed
my left temple; another splintered the wood of the lamp-post,
down which I slid like a squirrel, just as the officer,
who had coolly surveyed the effect of the firing, turned once
more to his men, and again gave the order,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"With ball cartridge, prime and load!"
</p>

<p>
Fear gave wings to my speed.  Had the ball that grazed
my temple been half an inch more to the right, or had that
which splintered the lamp-post been six inches higher, I
would assuredly have added one to the catalogue of killed
and wounded on that unlucky 4th of June.
</p>

<p>
I stumbled over the body of a man who was lying on his
back moaning in great agony and blowing bells of blood
from his mouth, for he had received a ball in the chest; and
I bounded with the speed of a hare towards the meadows,
where I once more sought the friendly tree which had last
night formed my hiding place.

CHAPTER XIII.
<br><br>
THE PRESS-GANG.
</h3>

<p>
After a time, all seemed quiet and still.  The mob had
entirely disappeared, and I heard the sound of drums and
fifes alternately rising and dying away in distance as the
troops were marched through the windings of the city back
to the castle.  I then began to think of returning home.
I burned with anxiety to tell my mother and little Lotty,
and to pour into the ears of Amy Lee the strange adventures
of the last day and night.  I almost forgot my fracas
with Macfarisee, it seemed quite a secondary affair to a lad
who had actually <i>stood fire</i>; and for a second time leaving
my hiding-place, I prepared to depart.
</p>

<p>
I had scarcely dropped from my perch and touched the
ground, when a loud "hallo" fell on my ear, and turning,
I beheld, about forty yards distant, a party of seamen armed
with pistols and cutlasses, and headed by an officer who had
his sword drawn, and whom, by the black patch on his left
eye, I knew to be Lieutenant Cranky, of His Majesty's
tender <i>Tartar</i>.  He had three or four other persons with
him; but whether they were prisoners or not, I never
lingered to inquire, but at once took to flight, my hair
bristling with terror.  I knew his party in a moment to be
the press-gang, a name so fraught with fear in those days of
ill-defined freedom, that I know not in what language to
pourtray it now.
</p>

<p>
"Hollo, you sir,&mdash;stop&mdash;bring to, or it will be the worse
for you!" cried Mr. Cranky, with an oath; but I turned
and ran, my heart panting wildly, almost to suffocation.  A
seaman villanously fired a pistol after me, and the ball
stripped the bark from a tree close by.  I knew that I
should have a better chance of escape amid the intricacies of
the city than in the open country, as any person would
readily afford me a refuge from a fate so odious as the hands
of the press-gang; so, after a <i>détour</i> and doubling like a hare,
I scrambled over two or three walls, regardless of iron spikes
and broken bottles, crossed a flower garden, and scarcely
knowing whither I went, found my pursuers rapidly
distanced as I dashed down a steep old alley, named the
Vennel, one side of which is formed by the crenelated
rampart, and an old tower or loopholed bastel-house of the
city wall.  At the foot of this street I saw a ladder, placed
under the door of a hayloft; I cast a hasty glance behind,&mdash;no
one was near,&mdash;I rushed up, drew the ladder in to secure
my retreat, and buried myself among the hay, panting,
breathless, and bathed in hot perspiration, while my heart
leaped almost in agony.
</p>

<p>
I had just made my quarters good in time, for in less than
a minute, three seamen ran hurriedly down the street, and
after looking about them, returned, swearing at their
fruitless chase, and at Lieutenant Cranky, who had sent them in
pursuit.
</p>

<p>
As they ascended the street, one paused and gave a
glance at the hayloft; but he seemed to dismiss suspicion, if
he had one, and passed on.  Had I left the ladder, they had
doubtless discovered me.
</p>

<p>
The lagging day passed slowly,&mdash;oh, how slowly&mdash;on!
Parched with thirst, weary and unrefreshed, I gladly saw
the shadows fall to the eastward, and hailed the approach
of night.
</p>

<p>
When all seemed still and sufficiently dark, I prepared to
quit my nest, and was just in the act of lowering the ladder,
when a man came out of the stable beneath, and uttered
such a shout of angry surprise, that I instinctively drew up my
means of descent again.  He surlily demanded my reason
for being about his premises.
</p>

<p>
I told him frankly that I had been hidden there for some
hours to escape the press-gang, and that I was perishing of
thirst.  On hearing this, his manner at once changed; he
invited me into his house, and offered me food; but, though
totally unable to eat, I drank a jug of stout ale, and feeling
invigorated and encouraged anew, I thanked him, and penetrated
into the city, which I had to traverse on my way home.
</p>

<p>
In every direction I saw groups of men in close
conversation.  Their tones were sullen, and their
denunciations of the Lord Provost and Baillies were loud and
incessant, for the blood which had been so wantonly shed
that day had set the hearts of all on fire with a longing for
revenge.
</p>

<p>
In the cities of Aberdeen and Perth, in the busy town of
Dundee and elsewhere, the effigy of the unpopular member
had been whipped, burned, blown up or hanged by the
populace, whom the magistrates allowed to do so,
unmolested, and the mobs dispersed in good-humour, and quite
content with their own performances; but the wise men of
Gotham, who ruled in the high places of the capital, being
possessed of a nicer sense of honour, or a greater amount of
servility&mdash;a higher degree of wisdom, or what is much more
likely, a profound depth of folly&mdash;had resolved to prevent
such exhibitions at the bayonet's point, and with what
success I have shown.
</p>

<p>
As I descended the High Street, the groups became
more frequent, and more vehement in their language; and
the same phrases used by the "Friends of the People"
on the preceding evening were of frequent occurrence.
The escapes I had so lately made, caused me to be careful.
I shunned every group, and more especially did I shun
the red-coated veterans of the city guard.
</p>

<p>
"Home&mdash;home," thought I; "let me only get home,
that I may relate to the dear ones there all I have endured
for the last six-and-thirty hours."
</p>

<p>
Vain wish!  Little did I then foresee all that was before
me, ere again I crossed my mother's threshold, or how much
I resembled "the leaf which is torn from the tree, and
which the wind of heaven blows about."
</p>

<p>
I observed that the oil-lamps, by which the streets
were usually lighted, were all extinguished.  Something
was evidently on the <i>tapis</i>.
</p>

<p>
I had reached the Tron church, when the appearance of
a great and silent mob, marching steadily and compactly,
and having aloft a man upon a ladder, made me pause, for
there was something in their silence and good order that
seemed very portentous of evil.  They poured out of the
narrow closes and steep wynds on both sides of the dark
Canongate, and, as these living streams united, they rolled in
one huge mass along the North Bridge towards Prince's Street.
</p>

<p>
This sight was sufficiently alarming to excite even my
curiosity.  Escaping the notice of the city guard by their
silence and promptitude, they marched on, no sound being
heard but the tramp of their feet and the subdued murmur
of their voices.  All at once, when half-way across that lofty
bridge which spans the deep (and then grassy) ravine
between the old city and the new, a red and lurid light shone
over them, revealing a thousand excited and upturned faces.
The man seated on the ladder had kindled a torch, and,
while waving it, proceeded to harangue his followers as they
bore him on.  He was the same sallow-visaged and haggard-eyed
orator who I had heard on the proceeding evening&mdash;the
unfortunate Robert Watt&mdash;and while being carried forward
by the human tide that rolled along the bridge, I again
heard the same sentiments and phrases uttered by him, the
staple topics of the Friends of the People, which, however
meaningless now, had a terrible signification in those days
when pikes were made by thousands in secret, when the
guillotine stood in the Place de la Grève, and the blood of
Louis XVI. was yet crusted on its platform.
</p>

<p>
"There was a time when the Scots possessed a spirit that
brooked no wrong," I heard Watt exclaim; "when they
were not so cold in blood that the dastard law froze them,
and when people took the part of the oppressed against the
foul oppressor.  A respect for the law is all very well, but
in the end it makes men cowards.  Respect for law and social
order in the face of injustice and tyranny is like an old
organ-tune&mdash;a piece of twaddle.  I say the people have
been wronged, yea, outraged and murdered, and we must
have blood for blood!  The law takes care of you&mdash;but it
grinds, robs, and crushes you to the dust.  Will the law
save a man whose throat is under the murderer's knife&mdash;or
the poor tradesman who starves under the tyranny of the
purseproud monopolist?  I respect the law, but I say,
curses blight the edict by which our fellow-citizens were this
day slain.  In our fathers' days, there was a law in Scotland
that he who was taken <i>redhand</i> after a slaughter might be
put to death in twenty-four hours.  The provost is redhand,
and but twelve hours have elapsed&mdash;the blood of our
citizens is on his soul!  Drag him forth, drag him forth, I
say, and to the nearest lampost with him!"
</p>

<p>
A yell of applause followed this terrible suggestion.
</p>

<p>
Again and again he referred to "the God of reason&mdash;the
social compact between the king and people; to the
Draconian laws, which drenched in blood the idol misnamed
justice; to the downfall of hereditary monarchs,
hereditary orders, tyrants, and lawgivers; equality of
rights, the conspiracy of kings against God and man, and
the majesty of the sovereign people!"
</p>

<p>
Then he wound up by quoting some forgotten Jacobin
poet, who wrote of monarchs thus:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Think not, ye knaves, whom meanness styles the great,<br>
  Drones of the church and harpies of the state,&mdash;<br>
  Whose sires accurst, for blood and plunder famed,<br>
  Sultans, or kings, or czars, or emperors named;<br>
  Who taught deluded worlds their claims to own,<br>
  And raised them&mdash;hell-doomed reptiles!&mdash;to a throne;<br>
  Think not I come to croak with omen'd yell,<br>
  The dire damnations of your <i>future Hell</i>!"<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Inspired by this choice piece of poetry, the rabble he led
murmured, growled, and applauded; but whenever he spoke
of the events of the past day&mdash;the blood that had been
shed and the lives lost at the behest of a ministerial
place-man, they uttered a yell.  Then rushing along Prince
Street, they turned into the ample space of St. Andrew
Square, which was then a silent and sequestered place, as
its mansions were occupied by the wealthy alone.  Now a
dozen of torches, shaking like tufts of fire, shed their glow
upon the excited faces of the mob, and I could perceive a
few sword-blades and pikeheads glittering among them.
Amid wild hurrahs, the house of the Provost Stirling was
assailed; the windows were dashed to pieces, and the
shutters, which had been closed and barricaded, were broken
in.  Two sentinels of the city guard, who were posted
before the door, fled into the fields which lay north of the
city; their boxes were demolished, and the iron rails
would soon have been torn up to force the front entrance,
which already resounded like a huge drum beneath the
blows that were rained upon it by the foremost of the
rabble&mdash;when, hark!
</p>

<p>
There was a flash through the darkened sky, as if a
meteor had passed over it; another followed instantly,
with the double report of two heavy cannon from the
Argyle battery, the signal for the seamen and marines of
the <i>Hythe</i> and <i>Tartar</i>, and for the cavalry again to enter
the city.
</p>

<p>
The first made "the sovereign people" pause in silence!
</p>

<p>
The second made them waver and commence a retreat
from the square; the retreat soon became a flight, and in
three minutes I found myself alone, seated near the railings
on a fragment of a sentrybox, the mob having entirely disappeared.
</p>

<p>
The provost of the city, whom the republican party had
marked as the object of their special vengeance, was at that
moment safe within the strong ramparts of the castle; and
in due time he received the reward of his intense respect for
the powers that be, and for preventing a straw mannikin
being burned.  He was made a baronet of Great Britain.
</p>

<p>
When about to retire, I was suddenly seized by the collar
on one side, and found a drawn bayonet opposed to my
throat on the other.  I was the prisoner of the two fugitive
sentinels, who had returned; and finding the coast clear,
resolved to make me a trophy of the night.  I struggled for
liberty, but in vain, and was forced to accompany them
into the old town, where, in ten minutes more, I found
myself a prisoner in the Tolbooth&mdash;the only one the guard
had, as yet, been able to capture on this eventful night.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV.
<br><br>
MR. MACROCODILE.
</h3>

<p>
On finding myself a captive in this gloomy old prison, and
in the custody of those grim and grey-haired Celtic
<i>gens-d'armes</i>, scarcely one of whom could speak (as I have said)
any language, save their native gaelic, I was animated by
rage and indignation, and made such a noise, that the surly
corporal of the guard, old John Dhu, a warlike remnant
of the Black Watch, who once, in the Parliament Square,
clove a man to the teeth with his Lochaber axe, threatened,
in his best English, to gag me with a drumstick, and get
an order from the captain of the Tolbooth to put me in the
water-hole.
</p>

<p>
This was the lowest dungeon of that ancient prison-house;
and though hourly tenanted by the refuse of society,
who were gleaned up in the streets, it was a dark, wet
vault, arched with stone, and so gloomy that its name alone
inspired terror.  This threat effectually silenced me; so
gulping down my wrath, I resolved to wait till morning,
when I was sure that, being innocent of all crime or error,
save proving the thickness of the caput of Macfarisee, I
should at least be set at liberty.
</p>

<p>
Another night of absence from, my anxious mother's
home!  Boylike, I could scarcely refrain from tears; but
tears, like entreaties, were lost alike on Corporal Dhu.
</p>

<p>
I upbraided, in my heart, Macfarisee as the author of
my recent misfortunes, by having excited my just
indignation when seeking to bribe and suborn me for his own
avaricious and revengeful purposes.
</p>

<p>
How I passed the night, I do not remember, whether
sleeping or waking; but when St. Giles's bell rang the hour
of nine, with other prisoners, who had been arrested on
suspicion of having been engaged in the riot of the past day, or
in the assault on the Provost's house, I was conducted by
the guard, with their bayonets fixed, to the presence&mdash;not
of the magistrates, but of the City Chamberlain&mdash;who, in
those strange times, possessed a power and a perquisite that
will scarcely be recognized or understood now.
</p>

<p>
He received a fee&mdash;some ten or fifteen shillings&mdash;for each
boy whom he sent into his Majesty's sea-service, and thus
every unfortunate urchin whom the guard could glean up
after dark, whether innocent or guilty of crime mattered
not, stood a very good chance of being sent off to see "the
mysteries of the great deep," with a cat-o'-nine-tails at his
back by way of an appetiser.  In this way, during the early
part of the last war, the chamberlain of his Majesty's
ancient capital of Scotland realized a pretty round sum
yearly.  In Aberdeen, this system of kidnapping was carried
to a still more atrocious extent by the magistrates, who
sold the boys of the city as slaves to the Dutch and
Spaniards.
</p>

<p>
What mattered it, though many a mother's heart was
wrung&mdash;perhaps broken&mdash;by the sudden and unaccountable
disappearance of a dearly-loved son; or that a fond father
found the hope of his future years&mdash;his years of old age and
helplessness&mdash;taken from him, if ten shillings or so were
put into the pocket of the douce, pious, and church-going
city chamberlain?  Yet such enormities were
practised in the capital of a country where once no
man brooked a wrong, without appealing to the sword and
dagger.
</p>

<p>
We were conducted into a large panelled room, of antique
aspect, opening off one of the great stone staircases of the
Royal Exchange.  There I was enclosed in a species of bar,
with three or four other boys, Corporal Dhu and another
grim city guardsman, with his fixed bayonet and long
musket, keeping watch over us; and then, to my dismay, I
found myself before Mr. Macrocodile, and one or two other
men of similarly ascetic aspect,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Most potent, grave, and reverend seigniors,&mdash;<br>
  My very noble and approved good masters.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
He was the bosom friend of Macfarisee; for years they had
mixed their prayers and their whiskey-punch together, and
wept in public over the sinfulness of this stiffnecked
generation.  He was one of the chief canters in the Reverend
Mr. Pawkie's synagogue; and I knew that he remembered bitterly
the affair of his wig, for his red ferret-eyes glared like
two living coals when he saw me; and, during the discussion
of one or two petty cases, in which boys were accused
of breaking street-lamps, or pelting the city guard&mdash;cases
which he heard and dismissed with, an air of vast magisterial
importance, mixed with no small amount of the cant and
slang used in the inferior departments of office, when power
is wielded by a parvenu.
</p>

<p>
Just before my "case" was to be heard, as the devil
would have it, Macfarisee entered the court, and gave me
(though endeavouring to conceal it under his last-will-and-testament
expression) a glance full of triumph and malice,
to which I replied by one of hatred and defiance.  The
ruling elder seemed very pale; one of his eyes bore a few
rainbow hues; he had a long piece of black plaster on the
bridge of his nose, and another on his head, and none of
these accessions tended in any way to improve his general
appearance.
</p>

<p>
"Oliver Ellis!" exclaimed a clerk, referring to a paper.
</p>

<p>
I looked up.  Macrocodile and Macfarisee&mdash;the Minos
and Rhadamanthus, who were to loose or bind, to condemn
or pardon&mdash;were ominously whispering together; and I
felt that in such hands my chance of the latter was remarkably
slender indeed; but pride inspired me to put a bold
front on the affair.
</p>

<p>
"Of what am I accused?" I demanded.
</p>

<p>
"Read the indictment," said Mr. Macrocodile.
</p>

<p>
"Being found in the square near the Provost's house,
when it was assaulted by a mob of villains, last night,
refusing to state what was your business there, and
maltreating and abusing the soldiers of the city guard when
they attempted to take you, the said Oliver Ellis, into
custody," snuffled the clerk, laying down the indictment, and
resuming his pen.
</p>

<p>
"They had no right to stop or molest me; the streets are
as free to me as to them."
</p>

<p>
"After dark?" growled Macrocodile, knitting his brows.
</p>

<p>
"At all hours," said I stoutly.
</p>

<p>
"You are a contumacious young dog!  Do you know
where you are, sir?" he thundered forth; "but we shall
teach you to respect the law."
</p>

<p>
"Hush, my worthy friend," whined Mr. Macfarisee;
"remember, there is a Power who chastens those whom He
loves; and in His name, let us chasten this wayward
one&mdash;yea, verily! yea, verily!"
</p>

<p>
"You are a couple of hypocritical rascals," said I, burning
with rage, "and have no right to meddle in my affairs."
</p>

<p>
"Ay&mdash;ay, indeed! we shall soon see that," replied
Macrocodile, with a malicious grin.
</p>

<p>
"He was seen among the rioters who were fired on by the
troops, yesterday," said a fat city officer, officiously.
</p>

<p>
"Are ye sure of that, Archy?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll take my solemn affidavit of it!"
</p>

<p>
"Then put him in the stocks at the Tron," suggested
Macfarisee.  "Yea,&mdash;the stocks, where a better man sat."
</p>

<p>
"Who?" asked Macrocodile.
</p>

<p>
"The Prophet Jeremiah."
</p>

<p>
"What! in the stocks at the Tron Kirk?" exclaimed the
other, with astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"No;&mdash;for shame, Macrocodile; the prophet sat in the
jougs, at the high-gate of Benjamin."
</p>

<p>
"Then it is too great an honour to put this young rogue
in the stocks.  By George, I'll pack him off to sea!" he
exclaimed, as if it was a sudden and not a common idea.
"Where is Mr. Cranky, the lieutenant of the <i>Tartar</i> tender?
Clerk,&mdash;write&mdash;Oliver Ellis, sent to sea, by order of the
magistrates of Edinburgh, for riotous and disorderly
behaviour in the streets of the city, on the 4th day of
June&mdash;may the Lord direct him to wiser and better ways&mdash;and
enter my fee opposite his name.  Corporal Dhu, march this
loon with the others to Leith, and hand them over as
volunteers to the lieutenant of the press-gang.  Take the
back-way, for fear of a rescue.  Officer, clear the court!"
</p>

<p>
Expostulation was vain.  I was seized by the collar,
a bare bayonet was placed at my throat, while my hands
were tied by a cord, and I was dragged out of the room.
Then I saw the last of old Macrocodile, his powdered wig,
and his wickedness; and the last, too, of Macfarisee, whose
eyes, full of triumphant malice, glared like two bits of grey
glass with a light behind them.
</p>

<p>
To avoid the streets, where considerable excitement yet
prevailed, and where strong patrols of the 2nd Dragoon
Guards were passing to and fro, they hurried me down a
dark stair, at the back of the City Chambers, so dark, that,
even now, lamps are burned there by day as well as by
night; thence, by a sequestered alley, named Mary King's
Close, and under the arches of the North Bridge.  There,
with three other boys, poor little ragamuffins, who wept
bitterly, I was thrust into a hackney coach.  A city
guardsman, with his bayonet, mounted beside the driver.
Corporal John Dhu got up behind; and thus escorted, we
were driven off to Leith at a furious rate.
</p>

<p>
I was choking with mingled emotions!
</p>

<p>
Pride and just indignation struggled with grief, at the
prospect of a long separation from my mother and sister,
and a terror of and repugnance for the fate upon which I
seemed to be hurried so rapidly.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap15"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XV
<br><br>
THE PRESSING TENDER.
</h3>

<p>
As the coach passed out of the city, three or four persons
on horseback rode in.  Among them was a lady in a light-blue
riding-habit, with a feather in her hat.  She was Amy
Lee!
</p>

<p>
I dashed my fettered hands through the glass windows,
and called aloud to her, in the desperate hope that her
friends, who were Colonel Rose and some officers of the
43rd, might rescue me; but the corporal, a stern and
merciless old fellow, thrust his bayonet into my left arm,
inflicting a wound which gave me considerable pain for
weeks after, and the mark of which I shall bear to my
grave.  Finding there was no remedy for present evil but
resignation, I sat still after this; but my cup of bitterness
seemed to be filling fast.
</p>

<p>
Near the entrance of the Kirkgate, Corporal Dhu
dismissed the coach, and showed us the priming in the pan
of his musket, swearing that he would shoot the first who
attempted to escape as dead as Julius Cæsar; a threat
which, I believe, he was quite capable of fulfilling.  He
then marched us straight towards the harbour.
</p>

<p>
We attracted little or no notice as we proceeded; poor boys,
pressed or sent to sea, by order of some tyrant bailie or sheriff,
being then a matter of daily occurrence.  The old harbour
was full of bustle and confusion.  Men-of-war boats, manned
by smart seamen or smarter marines, each with a standard
waving, and a little middy seated in the stern, were shooting
to and fro, while the scene was a wondrous medley of
nautical uproar.  Ships of all kinds, loading or unloading;
while piles of goods, waggons, carts, rigging, anchors, boats,
casks, and government stores, guarded by seamen with
cutlasses, and marines with fixed bayonets, met the eye on
every hand; for the North-Sea fleet were moored in the
roads.  A small corvette, of sixteen guns, was undergoing
repairs, and her artillery were placed upon the quay.  Near
her lay a few small Dutch and French ships, each with the
broom, the sign of being for sale, at the foretopmast head.
These were prizes, taken at sea.  They seemed sad, silent,
and deserted, amid the bustle of the harbour.
</p>

<p>
As we marched past the old Tolbooth of Leith, three
fellows, of uncouth aspect, who had been concerned in a
robbery, and were chained to the "jouging anchor," were
unlocked, and added to our party, as pressed men for his
Majesty's navy, for of such material did they make food for
gunpowder in those old days "when George the Third was
king."  This jouging anchor was a ponderous affair; an
appendage of some old frigate, it was a mass of rust, and
lay before the town prison.  Culprits were chained to it by
the ankles, until they were accommodated in the cells, or
until the Baron Bailie had time to hear and decide upon
their cases.
</p>

<p>
In 1792, Leith was still destitute of wet docks, and where
these are now formed, the sea flowed over an open beach,
and dashed its waves against the sloping bastions of an old
citadel, built in the time of the great civil war.  The London
smacks had only been established in the preceding year, and
smart craft they were, with enormous fore and aft mainsails,
all letters-of-marque; being furnished by government with
six carronades.  They carried the old Scottish flag at their
foremast head, and fought their way at sea, without guard
or convoy.
</p>

<p>
We were soon thrust into a man-o'-war's boat, and in less
than a quarter of an hour found ourselves alongside the
tender&mdash;a long, low, and black painted cutter, of most
piratical appearance, as she had been a French privateer, and
carried a revolving 32-pounder amidships, with a row of
brass swivels or patereroes round her stern and quarters.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant Cranky, her commander, was a sourvisaged
old fellow, of a terrible and buccaneer aspect.  He had a
queue of coarse grey hair, whipped with common spun-yarn,
extending at least three feet down his back, from
under a hat shaped liked Napoleon's, and bound with
broad yellow braid.  He wore a rough pea-jacket, adorned
by innumerable brass buttons; a broad waistbelt of black
leather, fastened by a square brass buckle, sustained his
heavy cutlass, in the rusty hilt of which he generally inserted
his left hand.  His right was occupied with a long clay pipe,
and he walked to and fro, whining away between the stern
and capstan, on the head of which stood his invariable
companion&mdash;a stiff glass of purser's rum-and-water; and as
there was daily a flogging on board, the dozens administered
always bore a due proportion to the number of glasses he
imbibed.  Whenever the hands were piped up for punishment,
Lieutenant Cranky stuck in his belt a pair of ship-pistols,
the ramrods of which were secured by a lanyard,
and thus accoutred, he would scowl over the deck, as if he
expected an immediate mutiny and rebellion against him
and the king.
</p>

<p>
He had lost an eye&mdash;"his starboard glim," as he styled
it&mdash;at the capture of Havannah; his nose had been
flattened by a half-spent musket shot in Rodney's battle off
Cape St. Vincent; half his right cheek had been shaved
off by a cannon ball somewhere else.  His disposition, never
a very meek one at any time, had been soured by long
disappointment, and exasperated by the tyranny he had borne,
and could now exercise in turn; thus, his whole aspect was
not calculated to impress me with pleasure or inspire me
with hope on beholding him.
</p>

<p>
"Boat ahoy," he shouted over the quarter as we sheered
alongside; "what the devil have you got there?"
</p>

<p>
"Prisoners, sir, to be handed over to you by the civil
authorities," replied Corporal Dhu.
</p>

<p>
"Been engaged in the riots, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," said the corporal, standing erect, and giving
Mr. Cranky an old-fashioned salute.
</p>

<p>
"Bring 'em aboard&mdash;all right.  We heard some firing
yesterday.  What the devil was up in that psalmsinging
town of yours, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"The 53rd fired on the mob yesterday."
</p>

<p>
"Served them right!  I would have grapeshotted the
mutinous spawn!  Any killed?"
</p>

<p>
"A few, sir."
</p>

<p>
"A good haul for old Beelzebub, eh?  Look sharp,
youngster, or damme, I'll have you whipped up to the
cross-trees!" he thundered in my ear, as I came slowly and
reluctantly on board.
</p>

<p>
I gave him a furious glance.
</p>

<p>
"Oons, sirrah&mdash;what is your name?" he asked, with some
surprise that any one under the rank of admiral had the
hardihood to look him full in the face; but, as I disdained
to reply, he uttered a terrible oath, and added, "boatswain's
mate&mdash;here with a rope's end! we'll cure you of sullenness,
you mutinous young flatfish."
</p>

<p>
Seeing now the utter folly of resistance, I gave my name,
which was duly entered in a book.
</p>

<p>
"You look deuced like the young swab who clapped on all
sail and gave us the slip yesterday.  So take care, my lad,
or I'll show you the foretop with a vengeance!" said
Mr. Cranky, as he gave a receipt for us to Corporal Dhu,
together with the fees for the city chamberlain, and then I
found myself hopelessly entered as a ship-boy, seaman,
prisoner, or what you will, on board of his Majesty's pressing
tender, the <i>Tartar</i>.
</p>

<p>
I gazed in agony after the shore boat, as it was pushed
off from the side of the cutter, and saw the brick-red coats
of the city guardsmen fading and their figures lessening, as
she was pulled into the old harbour.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant Cranky, who seemed a thorough officer of the
"Captain Oakham" school, eyed us fiercely with his solitary
eye.
</p>

<p>
"Now, my young mudlarks," said he, "I suppose the only
kits you have are upon your backs; but we'll soon have you
turned over as powder-monkeys to some line-o'-battle ship;
so console yourselves.  Get down below and under hatch,
every man and mother's son of you; and remember that the
marines have orders to fire upon any one attempting to
escape.  If retaken, by &mdash;&mdash;, I'll flog the hearts out of all
of you.  Off now, and, d&mdash;&mdash; my eyes, look out for squalls!"
</p>

<p>
One of the poor little boys who was with me now began
to weep piteously and call on his mother; so the boatswain's
mate thrust us all down below, bellowing out as he did so,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Pass a rope's-end here, some o' you!  Now, my young
swabs, stow your precious blubbering, or I'll pound you all
into jelly.  What a rum carawan of a Noah's ark we
should have, if we stood such nonsense aboard a king's
ship!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI.
<br><br>
THE WHITE-SLAVE SHIP.
</h3>

<p>
I shall never forget the emotions of horror and disgust
which came over me, on finding myself under the forehatch
of this prison-ship, for such it literally was.
</p>

<p>
About sixty squalid, bloated, drunken, and miserable
wretches, whose fierce or pallid visages were visible by the
dim light that shone through a species of grated ballast-port,
were huddled together in a space that was too low to admit
of their either standing or sitting with ease.  The state of
the atmosphere was frightful.  Our arrival was a signal for
every kind of jest and brutality.  Our pockets were searched,
and not a penny being found on any of us, we were hooted,
cursed, and cuffed without mercy.  Among this rabble were
several seamen, who had been recently captured, and were
now intoxicated and furious from the effects of the coarse
whiskey supplied at an enormous price by a bumboat woman,
whose craft lay close to the grating, and in whose supply of
alcohol they sought to drown all sense of care and
consciousness; freely, however, sharing their money and liquor
with the thieves and other refuse of society who had been
sent on board the tender.
</p>

<p>
In a corner I sat, crouching down, bewildered and
confounded by the stench of tobacco and bilge, of rags and
filth,&mdash;by the babel of oaths, songs, obscenity, and drunken
familiarity, amid which I found myself.  Some of them
quarrelled and fought, shrieking and blaspheming as they
rolled in a heap over each other, and then the sentinel at a
grating in the bulkhead only laughed as he surveyed
them&mdash;the fiends of this floating pandemonium&mdash;and poked at
those who came near him with the point of his cutlass.
</p>

<p>
Giving a wild glance around this horrible and suffocating
place, I clasped by hands, and, bursting into tears, exclaimed,
again and again,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Oh! what a disastrous destiny is mine!"
</p>

<p>
Ashamed or afraid lest this most natural emotion might
be seen, and subjected to brutal mockery by the unfortunates
about me, I crept close to the ballast-port, and fixed my eyes
wistfully upon the shore, towards which the ripples of the
rising tide ran in long lines of glittering gold.  It was
about the hour of one in the day.  The sun of June shone
in all its brilliance amid a clear, blue, cloudless sky.  I saw
the distant city, with its castle, its spires and lines of
streets rising ridge over ridge upon its seven hills.  I saw
the green undulations of the beautiful Pentlands, and the
far expanse of varied coast that stretched to the eastward,
vibrating apparently in the hot sunshine, and mellowing in
the warm haze, faint and far away.
</p>

<p>
I clutched the horrid grating, and shook it, panting for
liberty and escape.  I saw in the distance a hill and clump
of trees that overlooked my mother's cottage.  Reflection
nearly drove me mad, and the reader may imagine, but I
can never depict, how in my soul I abhorred the avaricious
hypocrite and the civic tyrant who had hurried me on such
a fate.
</p>

<p>
My mother! the thought of her&mdash;of <i>home</i>, and where I
was, filled me with paroxysms of grief, and rage, and agony;
for in boyhood we feel, I think, with greater acuteness than
in after years.
</p>

<p>
After a time, and as the evening came on, amid the horrors
of the place, I sat in a state of bewilderment amounting
almost to torpor.  I doubted the reality of my senses, and
kept repeating,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"It is a dream&mdash;I am asleep.  When awake, I shall
find myself in bed at home."
</p>

<p>
From this dream I was, however, soon awakened to a painful
sense of reality by a kick or a blow from some of the
wretches about me, as they quarrelled and fought with each
other.
</p>

<p>
As night descended a deeper despair came over me; yet I
prayed, not to God, but, poor boy that I was, to my mother.
</p>

<p>
I thought of her alone now, and a thousand acts of kindness
and of her maternal love&mdash;of my neglect and selfishness&mdash;came
out of the chaos of my mind, and stood vividly and
upbraidingly before me.  Even Amy and Lotty were
forgotten, or merged in the single idea of <i>her</i>&mdash;her desolation,
her age, and sorrow, and a terror lest I should never see her
more.  Could I foresee the future!
</p>

<p>
When the boom of the evening gun from the guardship,
pealing with a thousand reverberations over the calm flow
of the beautiful river, announced that the sun had gone down
beyond the western hills, a hubbub of voices on deck also
informed us that the crew of the pressing tender were casting
loose the canvas, heaving short on the anchor, and preparing
for sea.
</p>

<p>
As soon as her boats were hoisted in, and the tender was
under weigh, the hatch was opened, and we were all ordered
on deck from our stifling den, which a party of seamen
proceeded at once to swab and deluge with buckets of water.
The cutter was standing down the broad estuary of the
Forth, but making long tacks, as the wind blew stiffly from
the eastward.
</p>

<p>
I was now doomed to witness a scene which filled me with
fresh terrors.  A miserable and delicate-looking boy, who
had been pressed&mdash;illegally kidnapped like myself&mdash;proving
refractory, by order of Mr. Cranky (an officer of a species
happily long since extinct), was tied up to the weather
shrouds, and, while screaming piteously, was lashed on the
bare back till he was covered, first, with livid bars, and then
with clotted blood.  Ere this he had fainted, but a bucket or
two of salt water was dashed over him "to bring him to,"
and then he was carried below.
</p>

<p>
This exemplary exhibition rather tamed the tempers of
the pressed men, who gazed blankly into each other's faces,
and a few of them became completely sobered by it.
</p>

<p>
I had great difficulty in repressing an emotion of nausea
on witnessing this revolting mode of punishment; but, plucking
up courage, I began to look about me, with the resolution
of confronting and grappling with my evil destiny, and
of taking means, by fire, water, or bloodshed&mdash;I cared not
which, for I had grown desperate&mdash;of escaping on the first
opportunity.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII.
<br><br>
JACK THE MARINE.
</h3>

<p>
There were no boats towing astern; all were, as I have
said, on board, and at each tack the cutter was generally
put about a mile or more distant from the land, on each side
of the Firth.  Even if I could have dropped from the side
unseen, and escaped the fire of small arms that would certainly
salute a fugitive from the watch on deck, I doubted my being
able to swim so far as the shore.  Moreover, I might only
be able to make a part of the coast where inaccessible rocks
rose sheer from the water.  But as the night was coming
on, and cloudily too, my heart began to lighten with a hope
which was doomed to be crushed, when Mr. Cranky, at nine
o'clock, after the night-watch was set, ordered all the pressed
men below.  He was too old a sailor not to know the tricks
they were apt to play under favour of the darkness when a
ship was near the shore.  So we were all driven down like
sheep into a fold.  The lower-deck, about the ballast-port,
was crowded by the strongest men, who, as the atmosphere
of such a place in June was excessively hot, crept close to it,
to inhale the freshening breeze that came into the estuary
from the German Sea, while I was glad to content me by
creeping close to the bulkhead-grating, outside which a
sentinel was always posted.
</p>

<p>
He proved to be a marine, and hearing me moaning and
communing with myself till he became tired, he looked
through the grating and said, surlily,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Silence there, youngster; we've had enough of this
nursery nonsense!  All that take on as you do are sure to
tumble off the yards in the first puff of wind, or to be
knocked on the head in the first action.  It aint lucky, not
a bit; so haul in your slack while you can."
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry I disturb you," said I meekly.
</p>

<p>
"You seem a better sort of boy," resumed the marine;
"far better than the roughs we get aboard this precious tub
of a tender," he added, surveying me by the dim light of his
horn lantern; "here, taste my flip, will you? it has just
come piping hot from the cook's galley."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," said I, taking a good draught from the can
of hot ale and egg which he handed to me through the
grating.
</p>

<p>
"That is better than a pull at the scuttlebutt, youngster,"
said he kindly.
</p>

<p>
"For where is the cutter bound?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yarmouth Roads."
</p>

<p>
"Yarmouth?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Some of the North Sea fleet are there in want of
hands.  You'll soon be turned over to a ship, and in a few
weeks may be off the Texel watching the lubberly Dutch."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my God! oh, my mother!" I exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"What, you have a mother, have you?  Well, I had a
mother too, once," said the marine thoughtfully.  "Now,
tell me how you came here, my little man?"
</p>

<p>
I related my whole story, to which he listened attentively,
though I gave it at considerable length.  The honest marine
seemed much struck with the lawless manner in which I
had been treated, and said "it was a d&mdash;ned shame that the
son of any man who had borne the king's commission should
be put upon thus by a canting thief of a lawyer."  He
added, that he was sorry for me; gave me some more flip,
said he would look after me, and that if I wanted
"anything at any time, to pass the word forward for Jack
Joyce the marine."  He then turned away, for the relief
approached at that moment with a new sentinel.
</p>

<p>
I had imbibed a portion of this good fellow's flip in time,
having been so long without food, that I was quite faint;
and amid all my woes, my interior was beginning to cry (as
honest Sancho phrases it) "cupboard," in spite of me.
Thus, the effect of the hot flip, which was well mixed with
a portion of the purser's rum, was to set me into a profound
slumber; and, oblivious of all about me&mdash;in spite of the
creaking of guns, timbers, and bulk-heads, the grating of
blocks and cordage, as the cutter rolled more and more on
approaching the river's mouth, I slept heavily on the hard
deck&mdash;yet not so heavily as to prevent dreams and visions
of the happy home from which I had been reft thronging
thick and fast upon me.
</p>

<p>
I heard the voices of my mother and of Lotty.  I heard
in fancy the sabbath-bell of our little village church, tolling
slowly and solemnly in its old and mossgrown spire, echoing
along the wooded vale and over the hills of purple heath
and yellow broom, as it called to worship those whose
hearts (unlike those of the full-fed pharisees and pampered
parvenus of the city) were earnest, prayerful and humble,
like those of their sires of old, who put their broadswords
to the grindstone, and when kings and prelates oppressed
them, forsook all and went to the mountain side, to watch
and pray and fight, and in the end to conquer!
</p>

<p>
In my sleep, the sound of this bell, which was so much
associated with my home, came to my dreaming ear many
times, with the murmur of the mountain bee, and the
crispy rustle of the old oaks that shaded my widowed
mother's cottage&mdash;the altar of my hopes and heart, which I
never more might see!
</p>

<p>
With such tantalising visions still before me, I awoke by
sunrise, to find the world of water around me, the cutter
pretty far out at sea, as she had been in pursuit of a
suspicious little craft which had escaped her; and as the breeze
was freshening and now completely aft, she rolled heavily
on the foam-flecked waves of the deep-green German Ocean.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap18"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII.
<br><br>
OVERBOARD.
</h3>

<p>
The <i>Tartar</i> ran rapidly with the breeze.  Her white
canvas bellied out before it; her tall and slender topmast, that
tapered away aloft like a fishing-rod, bent as she rolled from
side to side; and all her running gear was blown out in the
bend, while far ahead streamed her long red pennant, rippling
on the air like a coach whip.  The land was seen low
at the horizon; but I knew not what part of the coast
we were off.
</p>

<p>
Jack Joyce shared his breakfast with me, and by his
interest I obtained pen, ink, and paper, from the sergeant of
marines, to write a letter home.  While thus engaged, under
the lee of the cutter's revolving gun, with a cask for a
desk&mdash;writing with aching heart and head, a tremulous hand, and
eyes full of tears&mdash;I was teased and mocked by the pressed
men, who peeped over my shoulder, punched my right elbow,
and squirted tobacco juice from their quids upon my paper.
This continued for some time, until I lost all patience; and
snatching up a marlinspike, gave one fellow a blow on the
head, which rolled him senseless into the starboard scuppers.
After this ebullition of wrath, which Jack Joyce warmly
commended, I was permitted to finish my letter (Heaven
only knows what agony of spirit I poured out in its pages)
in peace.  I consigned it to the care of Jack Joyce, who
faithfully promised to have it transmitted ashore for me.
</p>

<p>
Postage was not in those days what it is now.  Whether
Jack ever sent it I cannot tell, as it never reached its
destination.
</p>

<p>
Two or three days passed monotonously away.  We kept
close in shore, as Mr. Cranky, though not afraid of French
cruisers, was anxious to avoid them, for his small
cutter being filled with men like a slaveship, was not in
fighting order.  We were now off the coast of England,
and on the third night saw the light on Flamborough Head
sparkling like a star among the darkening waves on our lee
bow.
</p>

<p>
Ages seemed now to have elapsed since I had been torn
from my home, while the events of years ago seemed to have
occurred but yesterday!
</p>

<p>
While we were still creeping along the shore, Jack
Joyce came to me one evening, about sunset, when we
were tacking with a head wind, in dangerous and shoal
water.
</p>

<p>
"Can you swim, Master Ellis?" he asked, in a whisper,
as we leaned over the lee bow together.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said I.
</p>

<p>
"Well?"
</p>

<p>
"Like a fish," I replied, confidently.
</p>

<p>
"That is lucky&mdash;for I have a thought in my head."
</p>

<p>
"What is it?" I inquired, anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"You must escape to-night."
</p>

<p>
"To-night&mdash;when&mdash;how?"
</p>

<p>
"Hush!&mdash;yes, to-night, or your chances afterwards won't
be worth a piece of spun yarn.  We are drawing near
Yarmouth, and as there are lots of the North Sea fleet
there, the chances are ten to one that all our pressed men
and boys will be turned over to the first line-o'-battle-ship
that hoists a signal as being short of hands.  And once
there, there you must remain, as the impressed are never
allowed to leave the ship; they might as well be chained to
the guns, so you must leave the cutter to-night.  Do you
see that spark away down to leeward among the waves just
now?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said I breathlessly, as the marine pointed out
what really seemed to be a mere spark that was lost, and
seen alternately, as the yellow and frothy breakers of the
shoal-water rose and fell between it and the cutter.
</p>

<p>
"That is Sandridge Light.  I know it well, and the
channel we must pass through.  We shall run close in to the
light, and put the cutter about when within a quarter of a
mile of it.  Then is the time to let yourself gently into the
water, float till we are some distance off, and then strike
out for the lighthouse.  I shall be the sentry aft,
so don't be afraid if an alarm is given, and I am
ordered to <i>fire</i> after you.  Strike out, I say, boldly and
steadily for the lighthouse steps, and God bless you, Master
Ellis.  When you get home, tell the old woman&mdash;I beg
pardon&mdash;I mean the good lady, your mother, what poor
Jack Joyce the marine did for you, and she'll mayhap
think of me sometimes of a Sunday."
</p>

<p>
He withdrew abruptly, lest we might be seen conferring
together, and left me to my own anxious and bewildering
reflections.  My heart beat wildly and my head grew giddy
with hope and the anticipation of baffling my captors and
tormentors, for I viewed Lieutenant Cranky and the crew
of his white slave ship as both.
</p>

<p>
A haze was fortunately setting over the water&mdash;I say
fortunately for me, as the long clear twilight of June might
have made my projected escape a perilous experiment.  This
haze rendered the approaching night more dusky, and
compelled Mr. Cranky to take sail off the cutter.
</p>

<p>
His boatswain, a weather-beaten old salt, who knew all
the dangerous shoals they were among, as if they were his
own patrimony, now took the wheel, and I saw his iron
frame planted firmly on the deck, while the red glare of the
binnacle-lamps shone on his nut-brown visage, his bearded
chin, and bare brawny throat, as he fixed his eyes in succession
on the compass, the cutter's sails, the rising light of
Sandridge, and a single star that twinkled alternately on
each side of the topmast, above the cross-trees.
</p>

<p>
Close by, stood his crusty commander, wearing a tarpaulin
hat and coarse pea-jacket, watching intently the compass-box
with his solitary but fiery orb, to see how the cutter
headed, and uttering from time to time deep growls of
satisfaction, as his old shipmate, with unerring hand, kept
her full and steady.
</p>

<p>
"If this wind holds," said he, "in an hour we shall be
past Sandridge Light&mdash;it rises fast&mdash;and then we shall be
out of this infernal shoal-water.  What a devil of a bubble
it kicks up under the counter!"
</p>

<p>
In an hour then, thought I, my fate will have been
decided; I shall be drowned or free!
</p>

<p>
So cloudy or hazy had the sky become, that I was not
without the most cheering hope of achieving an escape.  The
waves had become black as ink, though flecked with sandy
foam, as they went in long and crested rollers over the shoaly
ridges.  I could nowhere see the land; but I cared not for
that&mdash;the beacon light was my guiding star, and the bourne
of all my present hopes!
</p>

<p>
The cutter was running towards it, close hauled on the
larboard tack, and I soon made out the beacon to be a huge
octagonal edifice of timber, planked, tarred, and pitched, like
a ship's side, and placed upon a long ridge of sand, from
which it rose on piers of wood and iron, inserted deeply in
a submerged rock.  I discovered all this by a night-glass,
through which the old quartermaster, with wonderful
condescension, permitted me to peep for a moment.  I then
crept away; and after securing a strong line to one of the
starboard swivel-guns, coiled up the slack of it, and lay
down close by, pretending to be asleep, till the tender
altered her course, which was to be my signal for starting.
</p>

<p>
In about a quarter of an hour&mdash;a quarter that seemed
like an age to me&mdash;I heard Mr. Cranky hoarsely give the
orders requisite for putting the <i>Tartar</i> about.  The wheel
was sharply revolved, the gaff topsail flapped heavily, and
still more heavily did the immense boom swing round as it
was jibed, and the smart cutter, when her square sail yard was
braced sharp up, fell off on the other tack.  At that moment,
when all was hubbub and noise&mdash;bracing and hauling and
coiling up ropes&mdash;I grasped my line, and slid noiselessly, and
feet-foremost, into the sea!  I instantly let go the rope, with
a prayer of thankfulness on my lips, as if, in doing so, I was
leaving for ever the place of my captivity.
</p>

<p>
I felt myself borne along with the cutter, and pressed
against her side for some seconds; and it was only by
exerting all the strength with which despair induced me
that I was enabled, by striking out vigorously, to release
myself from this strange influence, by which, in the water,
a greater body always attracts the lesser.  Then I lay still,
floating, and scarcely daring to breathe, as the cutter passed
me; anon I struck out, as Jack Joyce advised, "boldly and
steadily," for the beacon, the three lights of which cast three
long and tremulous lines of radiance over the frothy shoal
water that rolled around it.
</p>

<p>
I had scarcely taken three strokes, when the boatswain's
voice exclaimed, over the cutter's quarter,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Shorten sail&mdash;a boat, a boat&mdash;man overboard!"
</p>

<p>
"Pipe away, the crew of the dingy," added the quartermaster.
</p>

<p>
"A deserter!" roared Mr. Cranky, with one of his
terrible oaths; "come back, you rascally porpus&mdash;heave to, or
it will prove the worse for you!  Fire, sentry&mdash;fire, and send
him to Davy Jones or the devil, with an ounce of lead in
his skull for ballast!"
</p>

<p>
In terror I looked back, and saw a marine (but not Joyce,
who unfortunately had been posted forward), in the act of
levelling his musket at me.  There was a flash as he fired,
and I heard the ball strike the water, from which it sent
up a spout near me.  With a tact, for which, under all the
circumstances, I give myself no small credit, lest another of
these blue pills might follow, I uttered a loud cry as if
struck by the shot, and dashed about in the water, as if
disabled and sinking.
</p>

<p>
"There, d&mdash;n you, take that whoever you are, and go
down to feed the fishes," I heard the old savage Cranky cry,
with a triumphant laugh, as the cutter passed slowly and
solemnly, like a tall and shadowy spectre, into the gathering
mist, and disappeared, leaving nothing astern but her white
wake and me.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX.
<br><br>
THE SANDRIDGE LIGHT.
</h3>

<p>
Sturdily I swam in the direction in which I had last seen
the beacon&mdash;I say last, for to one so low in the water as a
swimmer, every wave interrupts the vision, and more than
once I had to make a kind of leap like a flying fish, to
ascertain whether or not I was proceeding in the right
course.
</p>

<p>
I had soon for my guide the triple lines of light which
shone from the three lamps of the beacon; and with joy
and growing hope I perceived the distance to lessen between
us more rapidly than I could have expected.  The reason of
this was, that the rising tide, and every long roller that
chafed and boiled over the ridge of sand on which the beacon
stood, impelled me towards it and the shore, which lay
about two miles beyond my harbour of refuge.
</p>

<p>
Nearer and nearer I came!  The beacon lights seemed to
glare into my eyes with a dazzling radiance; and by the
triple gleam they cast upon the tumbling water, I seemed
to be swimming amid a sea of fire, until I got within the
dark shadow of the edifice itself, and found myself among
the sandy breakers that chafed and boiled against the strong
and upright beams which formed its framework and
substructure&mdash;upholding it in the air some fifteen feet above
the ocean.
</p>

<p>
Panting, breathless, half-blinded by spray and salt, I
reached the slimy iron steps, which descended from the door
into the water, and were covered with seaweed, sharp shells,
and clustering barnacles.  Twice the recoiling waves, or
back-wash, sucked me off, and twice the long rollers threw
me forward again, ere I could clutch the lower step of the
ladder, up which I swung myself; and then, as if every
energy had departed, I sank down on the slimy seat, and
for a time closed my eyes, covering them with my wet
hands; feeling totally exhausted by the excitement of my
sudden flight&mdash;the double dangers, by wave and bullet, I had
escaped, and the toil and suffering of mind and body I had
undergone for so many hours.
</p>

<p>
I must have sat there at least ten minutes, shuddering
with cold, before ascending the ladder or stair to the oak
door of the wooden lighthouse.  I knocked and shouted again
and again with all my little strength, fearing that the rising
tide might sweep me off ere those within discovered me!
The roar of the white waves that tumbled over the long and
dreary ridge of sand drowned my voice; thus some time
elapsed before the door, which was secured without and
within by ringbolts, blocks, and ropes, like the gunports of
a man-of-war, was undone and opened; and I was confronted
by two persons, who were dressed like sailors or fishermen,
in canvas frocks, long boots, which had never known blacking,
red shirts, and red nightcaps; and who, with astonishment
expressed in their grim faces, asked me sulkily and
simultaneously, "how the devil I came there?"
</p>

<p>
One rudely held a lantern close to my face, while the
other uncocked and laid aside a pair of long rusty pistols,
with which he had armed himself; as it was not uncommon
for lighthouse-keepers to be made prisoners, by the French
and Dutch privateers, which prowled about the North Sea
in those days.  They were coarse and ruffianly in manner,
and of most sinister and unprepossessing aspect.
</p>

<p>
Staggering in, I sank upon the floor, all wet and dripping.
Then, while one made fast the door, and coiled the lashings
of it round the belaying pins on each side, the other (after
carefully investigating my pockets, and muttering an oath
on finding them empty) gave me a glass of raw rum, which,
though it went down my throat like fire, revived me
considerably.  Then he assisted me to a seat, upon a sea-chest,
after which, I pulled off my wet clothes, and began to feel
more collected, and to look about; while they questioned
me with great rapidity, for, probably, their life in the
beacon was not one of brilliant adventure, and my sudden
visit bore somewhat the aspect of an incident.
</p>

<p>
"Did you tumble overboard, youngster?" asked one.
</p>

<p>
"No," I sighed.
</p>

<p>
"Were you wrecked anywhere hereabout?" said the other.
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"Were you blown off shore, in a boat, or marooned on a
hencoop, or hove overboard by any one,&mdash;eh?"
</p>

<p>
"None of these have happened to me," said I faintly, and
afraid to tell the truth.
</p>

<p>
"My eyes and limbs! did you drop from the moon?
Here, take another pull at the rum-bottle, and wrap this
blanket round you; put on your considering cap, and tell us
all about it."
</p>

<p>
I tasted the rum again, and wrapping about me the
coarse blanket, which, though it resembled a Roman toga
as a garment, smelt horribly of tar, grease, and tobacco,
proceeded to relate the adventures which had befallen me
of late, dwelling especially upon the lawless manner in
which I had been seized by the city guard of Edinburgh,
and delivered by the chamberlain to the lieutenant of the
pressing-tender.  To all this they listened, with their
keen eyes fixed upon me, whiffing their long clay pipes the
while, and exchanging strange and somewhat sinister glances
from time to time.
</p>

<p>
I knew not what those deep glances portended; but, in
that sequestered beacon, with the mournful gurgling, hissing,
and chafing of the waves <i>under</i> and around me, my spirit
began to sink, and I felt more abandoned by fate than when
in the tender, with worthy Jack Joyce, the marine, to
comfort and to counsel me.  I remembered the examination
of my pockets, when half-senseless, and shrewdly
suspected I had fallen into bad hands.
</p>

<p>
When I had concluded, they continued to smoke in
ominous silence, and to pass the rum-bottle to and fro
between them.  At last, one wiped his huge, blubber-like
mouth with the back of his brown, hairy hand, and
said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Well, I rather like your giving a tap on the head to
that psalm-singing Scotch landshark, lawyer Macfarisee, or
what's his name?  But it <i>does</i> seem to me, somehow, a
twister,&mdash;a close laid yarn, that of yours, youngster."
</p>

<p>
"How?" I asked anxiously, for I was too completely in
their power to express indignation at being doubted.
</p>

<p>
"Why, as to your being pressed, as you say, by sodgers,"
said the other, who was named Dick Knuckleduster (from
a dangerous weapon of iron which he frequently wore, and
by which, when fitted closely into the clenched hand, a most
deadly blow can be given); "we don't believe a word of it!
You have fairly run,&mdash;deserted."
</p>

<p>
"Because I was foully entrapped!"
</p>

<p>
"Heyday! don't go for to abuse the king's sarvice, my
young 'un.  I'm an old man-o'-war's man, and know
Lufftenant Cranky, well.  I sarved with him in the
<i>Monmouth</i> line-o'-battle ship, at the Havannah; when I
was captain of the mizentop, and know that, tho a little
too ready with a curse or the cat, a better hofficer never
drew a cutlass or slung his hammock under a beam."
</p>

<p>
"I care nothing for all this," said I; "I hate coercion,
and was never intended for a seafaring life."
</p>

<p>
"Hate!" growled the fellow, with a hoarse laugh; "split
me, Dick, did you ever hear the like o' that?  He'd like to
be in a clean-going channel frigate, where the helm is
always put down when the captain wants fresh butter from
shore; or, mayhap, in the King's Majesty's yacht, which,
as everybody knows, never sails o' nights, but always anchors
at sunset, in nice quiet places, like millponds.  My precious
greenhorn, it will be quite against our conscience, in this
sharp war, to let the king lose such a valuable sarvant as
you."
</p>

<p>
"Conscience!" I reiterated.
</p>

<p>
It was a great word with Macfarisee, and when using it
their cruel banter made my blood run cold.
</p>

<p>
Too weak to remonstrate with them, I reclined upon the
chest and closed my eyes.  I thought of my mother, of
Lotty and Amy, and strove to pray; but memory refused to
supply me even with the most commonplace formula.  However,
by feigning sleep, I was relieved from the conversation
of those two ruffians (they seemed no better) in whose
society my malicious destiny had cast me.
</p>

<p>
"He's asleep, I think," said one, who was named Broken-nosed
Bill, puffing a whiff under my nose.
</p>

<p>
I snored in corroboration thereof.
</p>

<p>
"Sound, sound as a timber-head," added Dick.
</p>

<p>
"You know what shares is at sea?" asked Bill in a low
voice.
</p>

<p>
"I should think so!  I warnt six years a privateersman
among the Antilles for nought."
</p>

<p>
"And shares in a lighthouse, eh, Dick?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; split me! aint it at sea as well as a ship?"
</p>

<p>
"Then we understand one another.  We'll hoist a signal
and hand him over to the first king's-pennant that passes
her, as run from the service, and we'll share the
bringing-money between us, parting it fairly on the capstan-head,
eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Besides, on <i>conscience</i>, you know, we can swear he fled
from a king's ship."
</p>

<p>
"He'll get a tight flogging, anyhow."
</p>

<p>
"That's his business, eh, Bill?"
</p>

<p>
I remembered the poor little boy whom I had seen so
cruelly mangled on board the tender, and my heart sank
within me.
</p>

<p>
"We must keep a bright look-out, that this young
gudgeon don't take a swim for it, and give us the slip as he
did old Cranky."
</p>

<p>
"A swim! why, split me, if the great sea sarpent could
swim through the shoals and shifting sands from here to
Compton Kennel!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, he came to us uninvited, like a mermaid, and
blow me if we won't have what he is worth out of him!
Does the young whelp think we are to keep him in grub
and grog, on nothing a day or midshipman's half-pay?  No,
no; Dick, give a look at the glims, and then we'll turn in
for the night.  The wind is rising; we'll have a tough
squall before morning, and who knows but the devil may
send something ashore upon the Ridge by that time; there
were two craft in the offing at sunset."
</p>

<p>
The reader may imagine my dismay on finding that I had
escaped from Scylla only to fall into Charybdis; but nature
was now completely exhausted, and ere long I sank into a
sleep, so deep as to be undisturbed either by dreams or by
the booming of the surf as it boiled and broke over the long
waste of sand on which the beacon stood.

<h3>
CHAPTER XX.
<br><br>
DICK KNUCKLEDUSTER.
</h3>

<p>
Wakened by rolling off the sea-chest, on which I had
fallen asleep overnight, I found that day had broken&mdash;that
it was considerably advanced indeed, by the appearance of
the light, and for a minute I could scarcely realize my
locality or that I was not in a dream.
</p>

<p>
Alone in the lower story of a lighthouse, against the
timbers and below the floor of which I heard the sea
gurgling and washing with ceaseless and monotonous sound;
the apartment was octagonal: built like the sides of a ship,
caulked and pitched, with enormous beams of oak bolted
together by cramps and knees of iron.  The furniture and
appurtenances consisted of two sea-chests, two campstools,
seated with old canvas; a few pistols, cutlasses, spy-glasses,
and signal-flags, stowed away among salt beef, biscuits,
combs, razors, butter, plates, pots, and pans on the dirty
shelves, which were bracketed within the sloping timbers.
Besides these, were various casks, and odds and ends, the
salt-encrusted state of which indicated their having been
found in vessels stranded among the adjacent sands.
</p>

<p>
I ascended a ladder which led to the upper story.  It
contained two truckle beds, which, being formed of teased
oakum and tarry shakings, emitted a frightful odour, and
thereon were my worthy hosts in profound slumber.  I
resolved to turn to account the brief liberty this gave me,
and commenced an immediate inspection of the place.  A
ladder and hatch led me from this place to the roof,
where I found the lights extinguished, and, from a slender
iron gallery formed round the summit, I had a view of the
dreary sea boiling over ridges of sand, that were dry or
covered alternately, as the tide ebbed and flowed.  The
shore was visible, but so flat as to seem far off, though only
a mile or so distant.  The sky was grey and lowering&mdash;the
sea a dingy russet green, flecked with foam and full of
shifting sands.  The blackened ribs of an old wreck,
half-buried in sand and covered by sea-weeds, lay near, and
thereon was perched a solitary gull with grey and drooping
wings.
</p>

<p>
The only other feature in this cheerless scene was one of
those old square church towers peculiar to England.  It
seemed dim and distant in the haze; but indicated the
locality of a township or parish, and in that quarter now all
my hopes were centred.
</p>

<p>
The lighthouse was evidently without a boat, the two
occupants being apparently men who could not be trusted
with one.  Provisions and other necessaries were brought
off to them, from time to time, by certain officials on shore.
</p>

<p>
My spirit writhed and my heart sank at the prospect of
residing with such wretches, even for a week; and I had,
moreover, the miserable conviction, that neither my life nor
liberty were safe with them, after the conversation I had
overheard.  On that day, and the next, they were alternately
sullen and sneering, while, telescope in hand, from
their upper gallery they kept a sharp look-out for a king's
ship.
</p>

<p>
So did I, but with very different feelings.
</p>

<p>
Finding the double necessity of killing the dreary and
anxious hours, and perhaps of conciliating&mdash;if such were
possible&mdash;these sullen and brutal spirits, I assisted them in
trimming the huge lamps and reflectors, in cooking our
repast of salt junk, and brewing a great can of egg-flip; but
having been detected, in the evening, waving my handkerchief
as a signal to a passing schooner, the master of which,
on seeing it, actually altered his course and bore up for the
lighthouse, I fell into a serious scrape.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly I was confronted by my two tyrants.  Dick's
eyes glared like those of a wild beast, as he gave me a
violent blow on the ear with a heavy telescope, while the
other, with gratuitous ferocity, struck me down by a stroke
from a handspike, exclaiming,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Look out! or, split me, if I won't cut your rascally
throat from clue to earing!  Who the devil is going to
keep a loblolly-boy like you in grub and grog for
nothing?"
</p>

<p>
I fell senseless and bleeding on the upper deck, or roof of
the lighthouse.
</p>

<p>
I must have lain long thus; for, on recovery, I found
that darkness had set in, that the beacon was lighted, and
its three lamps, from the cavity of their vast reflectors, were
again shedding their radiated lustre far across the heaving
waves of the darkened sea.  There was no moon visible, but
a few tremulous stars were shimmering through the
gauze-like vapour that veiled the gloomy sky.
</p>

<p>
Stiff, sore, and chilled, with an aching head and eyes full
of tears&mdash;my cheeks damp and my hair encrusted by the
saline nature of the atmosphere&mdash;I staggered up and sat in
the outer gallery for a time, gazing sadly, and full of bitter
thoughts, upon the restless sea, which boiled and seethed
some thirty feet below me.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap21"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI.
<br><br>
RETRIBUTION.
</h3>

<p>
Smarting still with the blows those ruffians had given
me, I thought of all the evil fortune had wrought me, and
burned for vengeance; and terribly I had it, ere the
morning sun rose from the sea.
</p>

<p>
The sound of a strange voice&mdash;a woman's voice, too!&mdash;was
now heard.  A woman in that sequestered lighthouse!
From whence, and how had she come?  I heard also the
ribald fun and coarse laughter of the two beacon-keepers.
Slipping off my shoes, I crept down the ladder, and peeping
through the hatch in the ceiling of the lower apartment,
saw the Messieurs Dick Knuckleduster and Broken-nosed
Bill seated near a table, drinking and smoking with a
woman of repulsive aspect, but with whom they seemed on
somewhat intimate terms.
</p>

<p>
Sinewy, bony, and gaunt, she had the hooked-nose, large
keen black eyes, and thick animal mouth of a Jewess of the
lowest class.  She seemed to be about forty years of age,
and was clad in a dirty cap, over which a red handkerchief
was tied; a sailor's pea-jacket enveloped the upper part of
her person, a short red linsey-wolsey skirt shrouded the
lower; while her large feet, which in size bore a due
proportion to her dingy, clumsy hands, were encased in a pair
of old military boots.  Her visage, which was as yellow as
an old drumhead, was seamed by a hundred dirty wrinkles;
and her mouth had certain hirsute appendages, of a hue so
dark as to render her sex almost doubtful, and her aspect
diabolical.  She wore large gold ear-rings, and had in her
mouth a short black pipe, which was only removed to make
way for a battered tin mug, from which she was imbibing
gin-and-water, hot.
</p>

<p>
By the number of bottles upon the table, she seemed to
have brought to the beacon an ample supply of alcohol
under cloud of night; and, from the tenor of the conversation
that was in progress, I gathered that this fair daughter
of Judah was not an unfrequent visitor.
</p>

<p>
My attention was next attracted by several jewels and
trinkets which the worthy officials of this Pharos were
offering her for sale.  She seemed a bumboat woman, or
slopseller, such as one may find keeping a shop of the
humblest class in the meaner alleys of a seaport town; and
they addressed her by the euphonious name of "Mother
Snatchblock."
</p>

<p>
"This gold watch and ring ain't worth much," said she;
"but where did they come from?"
</p>

<p>
"The sea," growled Bill.
</p>

<p>
"The sea is mighty productive hereabout; did they bite
your jiggerhook, when fishing?"
</p>

<p>
"They came in the usual way, Mother Snatchblock; so,
if you must know, we had 'em from a gentleman, <i>as</i> escaped
from the wreck of the Dutch galley that foundered in the
last gale on the tail of the bank."
</p>

<p>
"Did he swim from there to the Sandridge?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay&mdash;every fathom of the way; in a rough, wild sea,
too, to the steps of the beacon."
</p>

<p>
"A strong fellow he must have been!"
</p>

<p>
"Strong&mdash;damn him!  I should think so.  Look at the
knock on the head he gave me, when I took his dainty ring
from him," said Bill, exhibiting an ugly and half-healed
gash, which his red knitted cap had hitherto concealed.
</p>

<p>
"The ring was't worth it, Bill, my boy."
</p>

<p>
"Come now, old woman&mdash;don't cry stinking fish; the
stone is a waluable stone."
</p>

<p>
"A bit of green glass."
</p>

<p>
"A real emerald, if I know aught about it."
</p>

<p>
"Which you don't," said the Jewess, placing the ring,
which was of great beauty, on the tip of one of her thick
dirty fingers; "but you should have waited till the gent
was asleep, and then&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Then&mdash;what?"
</p>

<p>
She passed a finger significantly across her throat, a
motion at which the ruffian laughed, and the other said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Sleep&mdash;confound his bones, he sleeps sound enough
now, lashed to an old kedge anchor.  Do you see the round
hole in the timber there?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"The ball we sent through his brains lodged <i>there</i>; but
pass the bottle o'stingo over here, and let us say no more
about it; for sometimes I think he rises out o' the water o'
nights, with the anchor on his back, and knocks at the
door&mdash;and faith, I shall quit this place when I can!"
</p>

<p>
The reader may imagine the horror and repugnance with
which I listened to these terrible details of the inner life of
the inhabitants of this solitary beacon.  After they had
drunk and smoked for a time, during which the woman
gave them all the shore gossip, squared accounts to their
satisfaction, and concealed the jewellery and trinkets about
her person, she said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"And now about this boy that you have on board&mdash;I
mean above stairs?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, and wot about him?" asked Bill surlily.
</p>

<p>
"Didn't we cotch the young varmint making signals to a
foreign schooner?" added Knuckleduster, with a sonorous
expletive.
</p>

<p>
"How did you know her to be foreign?" asked Mother
Snatchblock.
</p>

<p>
"By the swabs that hung over her side, and the lubberly
way she lay to and then hauled her wind again, when filling
her foreyard and standing off.  She nearly lost her rudder
on the shoal, so that youngster's signal might have cost her
dear if the wind had freshened."
</p>

<p>
"You've been feeding this young biscuit-nibbler too
well," said the kind Mrs. Snatchblock; "starve him,
Bill&mdash;for starvation is the best tamer I know of."
</p>

<p>
"Now that you speak out, I think we shall."
</p>

<p>
"And a little starving, or saving, its the same thing, will
increase the profit o' wot we makes on him, by giving him
up to government, so pass the bottle of Old Tom over 'for
a last pull.'"
</p>

<p>
"I'm blessed if it is ever out of your hand, Mother
Snatchblock."
</p>

<p>
"I means the water mug."
</p>

<p>
"You've had so much of both, old woman, that you don't
know one from tother; fire away, if you will&mdash;take the
stuff stark naked&mdash;but if you get one more sheet in the
wind, you'll find it troublesome work to fetch the cove of
Compton Rennel to-night in that punt of yours."
</p>

<p>
"For this young powder-monkey as will be," resumed this
hideous and now half-tipsy woman, "we shall get about one
pound one, from the lufftenant of the press-gang at Compton
Kennel, and we must go shares in that."
</p>

<p>
"Shares, in course, mother&mdash;but what! only one pound
one, when the bounty is so high, and the North Sea fleet on
the pint o' starting for the Texel?"
</p>

<p>
"Only a guinea, I tell you," responded the Jewess
doggedly, with an oath; "if I arrange all about them jewels,
you may well chuck this boy&mdash;what's his name&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Holliver Hellis," said Broken-nosed Bill.
</p>

<p>
"Into the bargain."
</p>

<p>
"Well, be it so," said the ruffians together.
</p>

<p>
"Now for another whiff, and then for the shore," said
Mother Snatchblock, buttoning up her pea-jacket, and
tightening the scarlet bandanna under her chin.
</p>

<p>
A sudden thought&mdash;a wild hope of escape now seized me.
</p>

<p>
This woman must have come off to us in some way.
Could this have been by the schooner I had signalled?
That was unlikely by the remarks I had heard&mdash;besides, she
spoke of leaving <i>immediately</i>.
</p>

<p>
I put my shoes in my pocket, slipped softly up to the
gallery again, and looking round, saw a little punt moored
to the steps of the beacon, and tossing like a cockle-shell
on the rollers that came in succession over the ridge, about
thirty feet below me.
</p>

<p>
"What shall I do?" I asked myself; "wait till she has
pushed off&mdash;then leap into the sea and swim after her, in
the hope of moving her sympathy?"
</p>

<p>
The revelations I had just heard, and the character of the
wretch, alike forbade the hope of such a result; so my
resolution was taken at once.
</p>

<p>
A lightning rod, which ascended from the water to the
roof of the lighthouse, was close by me, and bolted securely
to its side by iron cramps.  I grasped it, swung myself
over, and aided alike by my agility, by hope, and rage, at all
I had undergone, I came down hand over hand with ease,
my feet being firmly planted at every step, on the planked,
and sloping side of the edifice.
</p>

<p>
On beginning my descent, I observed that one of the
beacon lamps had been carelessly trimmed, and hung over
to one side, by which the flame already reached the woodwork,
and had set the joists <i>on fire</i>.  To repair this neglect
was still in my power; but to reascend might cost me
liberty&mdash;perhaps life.  My bones were yet aching from the
brutality I had endured.
</p>

<p>
"Bah!" said I, "let them swim if they can," and
continued my descent.
</p>

<p>
Easily reaching the steps, I sprang into the punt&mdash;untied
the painter, mechanically, and with the celerity of one in
a dream, pushed off vigorously from the accursed spot.
</p>

<p>
"Thank God! thank God!" I exclaimed, with a hurrah
of joy, and shipping a pair of sculls that were lashed to the
thwart, rowed away, I cared not in what direction, so that
I placed the deep blue water between myself and the beacon,
the door of which at that moment opened, and its two
inmates appeared on the slimy iron steps, lighting down
their fair visitor by means of a horn lantern.
</p>

<p>
The tipsy Jewess uttered an imprecation on discovering
that her boat was gone; but I was only eight or ten yards
from the beacon, and the broad glare of its triple lights, each
blazing within a huge round reflector, shone full upon me.
</p>

<p>
I uttered a loud and exulting laugh.  They saw me in an
instant, and all shouted at once a volley of hoarse oaths, and
orders "to come back," with threats of being shot if I
disobeyed.  But I laughed louder still, and pulled more
vigorously away, quitting the line of light, however, lest
they might actually put their threat in execution.
</p>

<p>
While the baffled Jewess screamed, stamped herself into
a frenzy at the door of the beacon, the two men disappeared
and hurried up stairs, I doubted not, to procure a couple of
government muskets which they possessed, for the purpose of
having a shot at me from the upper gallery; but the flames,
which I saw already filling all the second story of the
building, must have barred their way, for I soon saw them
again at the door gesticulating violently, while their dark
figures were strongly defined in black outline against the
red and lurid light within.
</p>

<p>
But still I shouted exultingly, and pulled breathlessly
away.
</p>

<p>
A strong odour of burning wood was soon wafted over
the water, for the whole beacon was built of timber, which
was old, dry, and being yearly pitched and painted, it burned
with all the fierce rapidity of an ignited tar-barrel.  Within,
the entire edifice seemed filled with light and flame, like the
cone of a furnace; suddenly there was a crash, as the red-hot
machinery, with all its wheels, lamps, reflectors, and
iron-work, vanished with the descending roof, and a pyramid of
red and roaring fire shot upward into the dark midnight
sky, diffusing a light in every direction, even to the far
horizon of the German Sea, and all along the low flat shore.
Every wave that broke above the desolate Sandridge, as it
raised its crested head, seemed for the moment a wave of
fire, for the whole sea became, as it were, a sheet of reflected
flame.
</p>

<p>
This sudden spectacle and terrible catastrophe arrested my
exertions; for a few minutes I gazed in wonder and
bewilderment.  Then moved by pity, I put the punt about, and,
animated by an emotion of generosity, of which the objects
were totally unworthy, sculled with all my strength towards
the spot, to aid the three wretches who merited so little at
my hands.
</p>

<p>
The iron gallery and the slender lightning-rod were
distinctly visible against the dark sky, for both were glowing
and red-hot; but the former fell, hissing into the sea, and
the latter, after waving to and fro, bent over, willow-like, in
the form of a slender arch, above the flames, which, as there
was not a breath of wind, and the night was exceedingly
calm, roared steadily upward, and with a terrible sound.
The beacon was soon reduced to a mere skeleton, amid the
charred timbers of which, the flames began to sink and die;
thus, in less than half-an-hour, not a vestige of it remained,
save the scorched heads of the wooden piles which had
upheld it above the sea.
</p>

<p>
As the latter again became dark, and I heard no sounds
but the lonely booming of the surf and the beating of my
own heart, shudderingly I put the boat about, and pulled
shoreward in the direction of a little red spark that seemed
to indicate a habitation; and seeking the while to avoid
the numerous boats which (now that the beacon was fairly
burned down) put off rapidly, with all their crews, intent on
rendering assistance when too late.
</p>

<p>
I had now no feeling either of vengeance or of anger at
the three miserable creatures who must have perished in
the wooden beacon; and, though in no way to blame for
the dreadful catastrophe, their hideous visages seemed to
pursue me as I pulled towards the shore, which rose rapidly
as I approached it.  I beached the punt upon a shelving
slope of land, and sprang ashore with a shout of joy, although
alike ignorant of where I was or what might next befall me.
</p>

<p>
The night was warm and the air was balmy, for it came
from fields of ripening corn.  I sought the shelter of a
coppice that grew close to the sandy beach, and stretching
my limbs at full length on the long thick grass, in my
danger and solitude, there made many good and wise mental
resolutions, now, when far, far from my mother's once
happy home, never to say or do aught of which she could
not approve, to remember all her instructions and precepts,
and her love for me, as a restraint from the paths of temptation
and vice.  In these good resolutions I found a consolation
in my loneliness, sorrow, and remorse, and so, after a
time, I fell into a disturbed and uneasy sleep.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII.
<br><br>
COMPTON RENNEL.
</h3>

<p>
When I awoke, the pleasant rustle of the green foliage
above me and the bright gleams of sunlight that flashed
through the waving branches, with the songs of the birds
that twittered from hedge to tree, excited a momentary
astonishment; but the booming of the adjacent sea, as it
rolled on the shelving beach, recalled all the adventures of
the last night, and the complete desolation of my position.
I clambered up a sloping bank, and for a time lay there
under the shady chesnut-trees, gazing on the sunlit sea, and
idly listening to the long rolling billows that broke in
white foam and in endless succession on the sandy shore,
abandoning myself "to the supreme happiness of doing
nothing;" but soon came bitter reflections, and with them
the necessity for action.
</p>

<p>
Seaward I saw a long white line of foam.  That was the
<i>Sandridge</i>; a few black stumps appeared above its snowy
line.  These were the piles whereon the beacon had stood.
I shuddered and turned away, resolving to be wary of whom
I trusted now, for already I had been (as they say in
Australia) twice bound and free within a week&mdash;bound by the
aggression of others, and free by my own energy.
</p>

<p>
As I proceeded and quitted the coppice for a highway that
lay between thick green hedgerows, the influence of the
beautiful morning and the fertility of the scenery raised my
spirit.  I was in a strange place, true&mdash;and without a penny;
yet, boylike, the joyous novelty of perfect freedom&mdash;the
memory of dangers dared and escaped (<i>for I might have
been left</i> to perish amid the flames of the beacon), made me
thankful and lighthearted, as I walked towards the
red-brick English town, on the old grey Norman church tower
of which the morning sun shone merrily.
</p>

<p>
Passing one or two manor-houses of quaint aspect,
with oriel windows and clustered chimnies, that stood
in lawns as flat and green as a billiard table; and by the
wayside, a few rustic cottages, buried under arbours of
honeysuckle and woodbine, a road that was so thickly
arched over by oak, chesnut and plum trees in full foliage,
as to resemble a leafy tunnel, brought me to the town,
among the red-brick and square modern houses of which
were many gable-ended, galleried and quaint old mansions of
the Elizabethan age.
</p>

<p>
I paused at the head of the principal street, for I felt
myself without friends, and what was still worse, without
money.  The morning seemed early, for few persons were
yet abroad, and the almost grassy vista of the street, which
was paved with little round pebbles, was silent and empty.
Close by me were the parish stocks, and thereon I sat for
a time to reflect on my loneliness.  A man passed me, a
bumpkin going afield.  He had a pitchfork on his shoulder,
and his face expressed that well-fed air of content which
is as peculiar to England as his little round hat, his canvass
frock, and hobnailed shoes.
</p>

<p>
"Good morning, measter," said he, passing thoughtlessly on.
</p>

<p>
"What town is this?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Where be you come from, not to ha' heerd o' Compton
Rennel afore, eh?  The best market town in any o' the
Ridings o' Yorkshire," he replied, and passed on, singing
merrily.
</p>

<p>
"Yorkshire!" I reiterated, while the name of the town
caused an emotion of alarm.  I remembered the press-gang,
of which Mother Snatchblock and Dick Knuckleduster had
spoken.  I was afraid of being questioned as a stranger, and
of being in some way implicated in the destruction of the
lighthouse; or, by my involuntary residence therein, being
deemed a comrade of those whose conversation and dealings
proved them to be murderers and wreckers.
</p>

<p>
While these and many other unpleasant thoughts occurred
to me, a large placard, surmounted by the royal arms
and running somewhat in the following terms, caught my
eye:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="t3">
"ALL GENTLEMEN VOLUNTEERS!
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"That are willing to serve His Gracious Majesty King
George III., in the Royal Scots Fusiliers, now commanded
by Major-General the Honourable James Murray, of Elibank,
lately Governor of Quebec, may apply to Sergeant Drumbirrel,
at the Chequers, or the 'Maid and the Magpie,' in Compton
Rennel, as twenty brave fellows are wanted to complete the
strength of the battalion, which is about to sail for the West
Indies, to fight the rascally French, Dutch, and Spaniards,
and lick them right out of the world.
</p>

<p>
"Every gentleman enlisting shall receive pay at once,
with two guineas to drink the very good healths of His
Gracious Majesty and the noble General Murray, of Elibank,&mdash;not
forgetting the Earl of Kildonan, Lieutenant-Colonel
of the said regiment.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God save the King!  Hurrah!
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"DUNCAN DRUMBIRREL, Sergt., R.S.F."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
My heart beat lightly as I read this rather grandiloquent
document.  The Fusiliers were my father's old regiment&mdash;"<i>the</i>
regiment," <i>par excellence</i>, of Lotty and me, and an
emotion of joy came over me.  Then, as if to supplement
this invitation to glory, pipeclay, and gunpowder, I heard
the sound of drums and fifes in the town.  Anon a crowd of
hobnailed rustics and other people appeared debouching into
the main street, and amid them I saw the tall black
bearskin caps and white feathers, the long streaming
ribbons, the drawn swords and red coats of the recruiting
party.
</p>

<p>
<i>Then</i> I felt that I was not without friends in Compton
Kennel, and pressing forward, I joined the gaping crowd.  I
was weary, hungry, and harassed; but the stirring sound of
the sharply-braced drums and the notes of the shrill fife
filled my heart with a new glow of joy and energy.  I
elbowed a passage to the sergeant, who, with his pike
on his shoulder, erect and stiff as its shaft, marched
at the head of his party, which consisted only of an Irish
corporal, a private, two drums and fifes, and eight or ten
cockaded recruits, straight to the "Maid and the Magpie,"
in front of which, after beating the <i>Point of War</i>, all took
off their caps and gave three cheers for the king and the
gallant General Murray.
</p>

<p>
Wistfully I gazed at the seven soldiers in their red coats,
faced with blue,&mdash;once so familiar to my boyish eyes; but
they seemed "new hands;" at least, I failed to recognize
them.  Amid the hubbub about the inn door, I seized the
arm of the halberdier, and inquired,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Are you Sergeant Drumbirrel?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, my lad.  What do you want with me?"
</p>

<p>
"To volunteer," said I.
</p>

<p>
"For the Twenty-first Foot?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"All right, boy.  What age are you?"
</p>

<p>
"Seventeen years."
</p>

<p>
"We don't reckon our time in the army by years, but by
the enjoyments we have," replied Drumbirrel, who was quite
master of the noble art of trepanning.  "In his Majesty's
name," he added, slipping the mystical coin into my hand;
"and now, come into the bar for our morning glass, and to
pass you under the standard."
</p>

<p>
And thus it was that I became a Royal Fusilier!
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap23"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII.
<br><br>
THE "MAID AND THE MAGPIE."
</h3>

<p>
I was immediately placed upright against the sergeant's
pike, on the shaft of which were accurately notched the
number of feet and inches which formed the standard height
for recruits in his Majesty's Twenty First Foot.  Though
considerably below the required gage, as a growing lad, I
passed the ordeal, and ere mid-day, with a few other
aspirants for fame and Chelsea, was duly attested by a jolly,
red-faced rector, who was a J.P. in that Riding of Yorkshire.
Two guineas of bounty were then paid to me, and in
the evening, with the sergeant, Corporal Mahoney, the
drummers, &amp;c., and a few more recruits, I found myself
enthroned on a table at the "Maid and the Magpie,"
spending my newly-acquired pieces of gold with singular
facility; and more likely to become a bibber than a
Hannibal, as I strove to drown care and extract
recklessness from brandy and tobacco.
</p>

<p>
A crowd of bumpkins and idlers filled the large
wainscotted smoking-room of the old-fashioned inn, which
Sergeant Drumbirrel had made his head-quarters; and as
red-coats were seldom seen in the rural district of Compton
Rennel, our redoubtable halberdier, who had all the
<i>bonhommie</i>, acuteness, and confidence requisite for a complete
recruiting sergeant, found himself acknowledged king of the
company.  He was a tall and handsome fellow, about forty
years of age; his hair was already becoming grey, and his
face lined by years of hard drinking and hard service in
America and the tropics; and his staple subjects for
conversation were his personal exploits in the fields of Mars and
Venus,&mdash;stories in which he usually stood prominently
forward,&mdash;thus: how, by following <i>his</i> friendly hints,
Burgoyne beat the French on the banks of the Hudson; and
how on another occasion he bilked an innkeeper at Chatham;
for he deemed one exploit quite as worthy of consideration
as the other.
</p>

<p>
He knew all the tricks of the recruiting service; enabled
recruits to pass the standard by false scalps and glued cork
heels, and made no secret of his art before his auditors.
While he imbibed and expressed a hearty contempt for all
civilians; he deemed it quite as much his duty to trepan as
to enlist them; thus, by his own account, he had brought
many gallant fellows into his Majesty's service by deluding
them into an exchange of clothes with him, taking care to
leave a <i>shilling</i> in one of the pockets; on the discovery of
which, he desired the wearer to keep it in the king's name,
and marched him straight to the nearest J.P. for attestation.
He had freely proffered commissions, enlisting many
as captains, colonels, and knights of the Bath and Garter;
he had slipped "the shilling" into a bumpkin's pocket, or
into his hand when shaking it, and then sworn in a whole
vocabulary of oaths that it was given in the name of his
Majesty.
</p>

<p>
From time to time, the health of the latter was drunk at
my expense, with great vociferation and loyalty, the sergeant
sitting the while at the head of a long bare table, armed
with a huge Toby-tosspot jug (formed like a little squat man
in boots, with a three-cocked hat, each angle of which was a
mouth-piece); it was full of ruddy, foaming ale,&mdash;Yorkshire
home-brewed.
</p>

<p>
"Are you wise," I whispered, "to let out all the secrets
of your art before these fellows?"
</p>

<p>
"Wise, lad?" said he, "I never was wise, and 'tis too
late to learn wisdom now; besides, what is the use of being
wise?  'Tis better far to be jolly."
</p>

<p>
"But those who overhear you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"May go and be hanged," said he; "our beating order
expires to-night, and to-morrow we march for Hull to join
the regiment, and I don't care how soon we embark; for I
begin to tire alike of barrack life, recruiting, and garrison
duty."
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah! the sooner we embark the better," said I,
with a shout; for now the fumes of liquor, tobacco, and the
general odour of the room itself, were overpowering, while
the noise, confusion, singing, quarrelling, and the voices of
women lamenting the enlistment of sons, brothers, and
lovers, made up a Babel, from which I could not escape, as
Sergeant Drumbirrel was too old a soldier to trust a recruit
for an instant out of his sight, until he was duly "turned
over" to the staff at head-quarters.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, stay at home, my dear&mdash;dear son," exclaimed a
poor old woman imploringly to a tipsy rustic, whose
wide-awake hat was adorned by the tricoloured streamers of the
gallant 21st; "stay at home with your old mother, who
loves you so well, and do not go to the sodgering, leaving
her to starvation and grief."
</p>

<p>
Though applied to another, these words sank deeply and
bitterly into my own heart; but it was too late to retreat
now.  The bumpkin to whom she spoke tore off his gay
cockade, and began to weep like a huge tipsy boy as he
was.
</p>

<p>
"Here, you young devil, take a pull of this," said the
sergeant, proffering his foaming jug.  "Mother of Moses! wait,
old lady, till you see your son in his red coat and
captain's <i>epaulettes</i>.  The first duke that has any live stock
in the shape of scampering daughters will have him to
dinner directly.  Hurrah for the old 21st!  Keep up your
hearts, my boys, for here are the sinews of war!"
</p>

<p>
With these words he refreshed us all, by displaying a
handful of guineas, which, however, were not his own, but
the marching money of the whole party.  This timely
display silenced the regrets of all, save one young fellow,
upon whose shoulder a very pretty girl hung, and wept
bitterly.
</p>

<p>
"Is this your sweetheart?" asked the sergeant, whose
rubicund visage expressed a curious combination of
commiseration and disgust.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied the recruit angrily, for he now viewed our
commander as his tempter and enemy.
</p>

<p>
"Well, our colonel does not approve of married men on
foreign service, so you may as well transfer her to some one
else."
</p>

<p>
"Tony&mdash;my dear Tony!" sobbed the girl.
</p>

<p>
"So you're in love, my girl," continued the sergeant;
"get out of it as soon as you can, for your Tony is a fusilier
now, and love rarely survives a change of quarters.  I have
done a little in the love-making way myself, and speak from
experience."
</p>

<p>
"Love, like destiny, should be fixed, unchanging," said I,
enthusiastically, as I thought of poor little Amy Lee.
</p>

<p>
"Desthiny," reiterated Mahony, our Irish corporal; "and
what the divil's that?"
</p>

<p>
"Our fate in life."
</p>

<p>
"I've known what <i>fate</i> were on the line o' march in
Flanders, when my boots pinched&mdash;is it that ye mane?"
</p>

<p>
"Fate," said Drumbirrel, ponderingly&mdash;"don't know much
about it.  I know that every bullet has its billet&mdash;a saying
we have in the army&mdash;and it comes pretty much to the same
thing.  But be jolly, youngsters, and you may all come in
time to the <i>halbert</i>," he added, with a wink which made all
the soldiers laugh, as his speech contained an allusion known
to them alone.
</p>

<p>
"Thunder and blazes!" exclaimed Corporal Mahony
"here is that unbelieving fifer ating mate on a Friday, like
a heretical Protestant."
</p>

<p>
"Well, there's no fast to the <i>poteen</i>&mdash;glory be to God!"
replied the fifer, who was his countryman; "so fire away,
my boys, till the butt-end of the morning."
</p>

<p>
"Silence all!" commanded the sergeant, who seemed
literally to live on tobacco-smoke and brandy-and-water;
"silence for a song, or I'll knock the dominoes out of your
jaws with my halbert&mdash;and, drummer, brace up, for an
accompaniment."
</p>

<p>
With these words he struck up a rollicking barrack-room
ditty of the day, in the prolonged "Tol-de-rol-lol" of which
the whole party joined, and the drum was added, so that the
din, with the clattering of jugs on the table, and iron heels
on the floor, was tremendous.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Behold poor Will, just come from drill,<br>

<p>
Our halberdier, who had become considerably the worse
of his potations, here became inarticulate; and would have
fallen off his chair, but was recovered by Corporal Mahony
(a prompt doctor on such occasions), who, in five minutes,
sobered him by pouring down his throat a little tea, dashed
with strong vinegar.
</p>

<p>
The society among which I was thrown sickened, and the
drunken uproar almost deafened, me; thus I gladly retired
to my pallet, in a miserable garret, which was allotted to
the corporal and myself.  Drumbirrel, having discovered,
through the medium of his brandy-and-water, that the
blowsy landlady was absolutely beautiful, lingered behind.
</p>

<p>
Overcome by the effects of his recent orgie, Mahoney soon
dropped asleep, and I was left to my own thoughts.
</p>

<p>
So I was to be a soldier, after all!  It seemed the
immutable dictum of fate&mdash;of a destiny against which there was
no contending; and by this almost atheistical sophistry
(rather than by the pressing argument of necessity) I
endeavoured for a time to stifle regret, and the stings of a
conscience that upbraided me, for deserting my mother in
her old age and my sister in her early youth.
</p>

<p>
But the die was cast, and thus I strove to find consolation
in deeming myself a fatalist.
</p>

<p>
I knew that my mother would weep for me&mdash;yea, bitterly;
and that how dear my desertion (the whole circumstances
of which I might never be able to explain) cost her, would
be known only to God and her own gentle heart; and this
conviction sank like iron into my soul.
</p>

<p>
Our quiet little cottage&mdash;the peaceful village home I
might never see again, came vividly before me.  With a
swollen heart, and eyes full of bitter tears, I thought I never
loved them all so dearly as on the night of that day, the
most eventful of my life.
</p>

<p>
I never closed an eye, and when our drum beat before
dawn, in the echoing market-place of Compton Rennel, I
started unrefreshed from my tear-wetted pillow, and prepared
to march, with other recruits, for the head-quarters of
the Scots Fusiliers.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap24"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIV
<br><br>
SERGEANT DRUMBIRREL.
</h3>

<p>
The regiment which I had joined was entirely composed
of Scotsmen, with a very few exceptions, being one of the
old national corps which had existed before the union of
the countries; but, as twenty men were required to complete
the strength before embarkation, the lieutenant-colonel,
the Earl of Kildonan, had obtained a beating-order, and
sent out parties from his head-quarters, to obtain recruits in
England, and hence my meeting with Sergeant Drumbirrel
in the little market town of Compton Kennel.
</p>

<p>
The regiment had been raised in 1678, by Charles, fifth
Earl of Mar, for the service of Charles II.; it was then
armed with light muskets, and hence the name of <i>Fusiliers</i>,
which it still retains, even in these our days of breechloaders,
Whitworth and Lancaster rifles.  Its first baptism in blood
was at the battle of Bothwellbrig, and after serving in all
the useless and wanton wars of Orange William, of Queen
Anne, down to the campaigns of Marlborough, Peterborough,
and Cornwallis, it was now about to commence a new career
of glory, under Sir Charles Grey, in the conquest of the
West Indian Isles.
</p>

<p>
As we marched along the dusty highway, all this was told
me by Sergeant Drumbirrel, who, with all his recruiting
tricks, was a droll and intelligent fellow from Ayrshire; and
a veritable record of all the past history of the Scots
Fusiliers, which, with the true <i>esprit de corps</i> of a British
soldier, he declared and believed to be the <i>first</i> regiment in
the civilized world.
</p>

<p>
An irritated father having followed us, with the intention
of giving a farewell horse-whipping to his son, who had
enlisted, overtook our party, when halted at the first
wayside inn, about ten miles from Compton Kennel; but our
halberdier was ready for any emergency, being a man of
endless resource.  To save the youth's bacon, he tied him
up in a sack, and placed him among twenty others, which
were filled with potatoes, in a room, into which the
astonished farmer had traced his son, without being able to
discover him; and this trifling incident furnished the party
with a subject for merriment and jokes, until we reached
our halting-place for the night.  The lad's name was Tom
Telfer, of whom, more anon.
</p>

<p>
Perceiving that I was very much cast down in spirit, and
also that I kept somewhat aloof from my companions,
Sergeant Drumbirrel pressed me to drink.
</p>

<p>
"You made me take too much last night," said I,
reproachfully.
</p>

<p>
"Too much! why, we drank the best of brandy, so that
is impossible."
</p>

<p>
"My mother&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Come! don't be a Molly and quote your mother, now
when you are a soldier; but what did <i>she</i> say?"
</p>

<p>
I sighed bitterly and replied,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"She ever taught me that liquor was an enemy."
</p>

<p>
"Then you should do as I do."
</p>

<p>
"How is that?"
</p>

<p>
"Make it a <i>friend</i>.  Here, boy, the smallest drop in life
won't do you the least harm; a hair of the dog&mdash;you know
the rest."
</p>

<p>
Thus urged, I took a draught of brandy-and-water from
the sergeant's canteen, and thereafter became considerably
invigorated and more communicative.
</p>

<p>
"Did you know Captain Ellis, of the Fusiliers," I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Ellis&mdash;Ellis, who served with Burgoyne, and was killed
on the banks of the Hudson?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Know him&mdash;odd's life, lad, and that I did!  A kind
good friend he was to me, and saved me once from the
halberts, when found asleep on my post on a cold and wintry
American night.  A better officer or a braver one never
wore a red coat!  I was by his side when the death-shot
struck him, and I was one of those who buried him at the
foot of a tree before we retired, and just as night was coming
on, for we all loved the captain too well to leave him without
a soldier's grave.  Was he a relation of yours, my lad?"
</p>

<p>
Touched by what the sergeant said in his blunt honest
way, my eyes filled with tears, and I replied,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I am his only son."
</p>

<p>
"You!"
</p>

<p>
"I."
</p>

<p>
"You, little Oliver, whom I carried on my back on the
march to Skenesborough, when the baggage-waggons broke
down and were lost in the woods!" exclaimed the sergeant,
grasping both my hands with friendly warmth; "well,
well, what queer things do come about in this world!  You
have grown so much, I could never have known you; and
ten years in America and Jamaica have made some change
in me.  I have no need for hair powder <i>now</i>, Master Oliver;
time is powdering me fast enough.  You must tell me how
this came to pass; and the good lady your mother&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I have been most ungrateful in leaving her; though the
act was somewhat involuntary."
</p>

<p>
"Too late to think of that now.  Your health again,
Master Oliver.  I hope to see you a captain yet, like your
father (as to <i>me</i>, I've got to the top of my profession).  You
will find your name a password to every heart in the
Fusileers."
</p>

<p>
The sergeant took a long draught from his canteen and
resumed,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"In the hard winter of '75, when Quebec was besieged
by the Yankees, we suffered horribly, though <i>I told</i> the
general how it would be.  It made one melancholy to see
the poor, pale, wasted soldiers full of spirit, though their
canteens and haversacks were empty, patient though suffering,
sick at heart in soul and body, wolf-eyed by famine,
toil, and battle, standing on their dreary posts, at
Quebec, among the frozen snow, through which the
bare skeletons of men and horses were everywhere visible.
One night I must have died of cold (for my watchcoat was
frozen like a deal board, and the flesh of my fingers stuck
to the barrel of my firelock), but for your father, Master
Oliver.  He gave me his blanket to wrap round me, and
shared with me the contents of a canteen, as I to-day am
proud to do with you.  God bless him, he had the heart to
feel for a poor comrade.  I remember the storming of
Skenesborough, when he got that ugly knock on the head.  We
were in brigade with the old '9th and 20th.'  I volunteered
for the forlorn hope; for being a bit of a devil, I always went
for anything desperate; and I remember, as if 'twere
yesterday, the night of the 5th of July and the preparations,
we stormers made for the event of the next day."
</p>

<p>
"Preparations&mdash;you would be reading your Bibles, I
suppose?" said I simply.
</p>

<p>
"Bibles!" reiterated the sergeant, bursting into a loud
fit of laughter.
</p>

<p>
"How, then, did you prepare?"
</p>

<p>
"By changing every rag we possessed into ready money
at the sutler's tent&mdash;by eating and drinking and fun; for if
we survived, a dead man's kit would always come handy,
and if we were knocked on the head, what the devil was
the use of letting ours come to the drumhead, or be buried
in the trenches with us?  So a jolly night we had of it,
cleaning our firelocks, snapping the flints, drinking and
singing,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Why, soldiers, why<br>
  Should we be melancholy boys,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose business 'tis to die?'<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Well, at three o'clock in the morning of the 6th, we
landed&mdash;formed in the water, and rushing up the mountain, assailed
the stockades, while the general, by my advice&mdash;for, as I
said before, General Burgoyne always took <i>my</i> advice&mdash;sent
the 20th in rear of the fort to cut off the retreat of the
Yankees; but they all escaped save a few prisoners.  My
eyes, Master Oliver, I remember well the first time the good
captain and I were under fire together.  It was on that
8th of July, when we were detached towards Fort Ann to
support His Majesty's 9th foot, which was attacked by
hordes of Yankees, French, and wild Indians, who are worse
than incarnate fiends.  A terrible march we had of it,
cutting down trees to clear a way where men never trod
before; fording weedy creeks, and floundering through
reedy marshes in heavy marching order, with knapsacks and
blankets, campkettles, and sixty rounds per man, till the
30th of July, when we crossed the Hudson by a bridge
of boats.  And there it was that General Sir John
Burgoyne came galloping up to me and said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'Duncan, what do you think of the position of these
rascally Yankees?'
</p>

<p>
"'Send forward the 20th and the 62nd, general,' said
I, 'and if they fail, the 21st will be sure to settle the
business.'
</p>

<p>
"'You're right, sergeant&mdash;you always are right.'
</p>

<p>
"'Thank you kindly, general,' said I, saluting him, for I
was always very respectful.  So on went the old Kingsleys,
as we always called the 20th, and next the 62nd; but
deuce a thing they did but blaze away their powder and
lose their men in heaps, till we&mdash;that is, the Fusiliers,
Master Oliver&mdash;came up, shoulder to shoulder in line, with
colours flying, and the drums and fifes playing 'Britons,
Strike Home!' and <i>home</i> we did strike with the charged
bayonet; for, as Sir John says in his despatch (though
ungrateful enough, never to mention <i>me</i>), 'just as night closed
in, the enemy gave ground on all sides, and left us
completely masters of the field.'"
</p>

<p>
The sergeant and I became sworn comrades; we had now
a thousand things to talk of.  He was kind, attentive,
consolatory, and said everything he could think of to fire my
energy and keep my spirit up.  Under his influence, it rose
superior to the thoughts that had crushed it; and I now
resolved to become, if possible, the arbiter of my own
destiny, agreeing with Musæus, that "an <i>active</i> man is not
content with being what he is; but strives to <i>become</i> what
he <i>can be</i>."

<h3>
CHAPTER XXV
<br><br>
HEAD-QUARTERS.
</h3>

<p>
We joined the head-quarters of the regiment, then lying
in the barracks of Kingston-upon-Hull, and after being
inspected and approved of, by our lieutenant-colonel&mdash;the
Earl of Kildonan&mdash;a fine young soldier, who had served
throughout the two campaigns of the War of Independence
in America, I was "turned over," as the phrase is, to
Captain Glendonwyn'a company, by Mr. Bolster, the
adjutant, and forthwith commenced my initiation into the
mysteries of the goose-step and other calisthenic exercises.
I was passed rapidly from squad to squad.  Though my heart,
yet, was far away at home, my spirit went with the task
that was set me; thus I was soon declared fit for duty and
was put on guard.
</p>

<p>
The strictness with which I conformed to every rule soon
attracted the attention of my captain and of the staff.  I
interfered with none, and even the most officious corporal
could not discover a military fault in me.  I soon ceased to
be deemed a "new-come," or stigmatized as a "Johnnyraw."  I
was often too generous with my pittance of pay, for being
unsuspicious, the artful fleeced me of it, and thus I was
often obliged to "box Harry" till pay-day came; but as I
was always on good terms with the pretty young
Englishwoman (a sergeant's wife), who messed me, I did not
find this so difficult as other spendthrifts, who were older,
less favoured by nature, or less suave than I; for my gentler
breeding made me a favourite with all the women in the
barrack.
</p>

<p>
I remember my first guard well, for there was a grim
incident connected with it.
</p>

<p>
When I was on sentry at the mainguard-gate, about the
hour of five, on a cold, raw, misty morning, two of our
officers passed quietly out.  They were muffled in their
blue regimental cloaks, and seemed pale, like men who had
been all night awake.  They were excited too&mdash;though
somewhat silent.  In a few minutes <i>other two</i>, accompanied by
Dr. Splints, our assistant-surgeon, also passed out; and then
I surmised that their expedition was nothing less than a hostile
meeting, for such affairs were of every-day occurrence in
those hot times of high punctilio, and when in every corps
there were a few firebrands and fighting men, who made
themselves the arbiters of every petty quarrel, and urged
that blood alone could wipe out the most trivial or imaginary
slight.
</p>

<p>
I was not wrong in my supposition.  Being a young
soldier, I was pondering whether or not I should call the
officer of the guard, when I heard two shots fired
simultaneously in a field not far from the barracks; and in a
few minutes, a terrified rustic came hurriedly to the gate
for a stretcher, on which two files of the guard, soon after,
bore in one of the four officers whom I had seen pass out&mdash;a
fine young lad, the lieutenant of our light company&mdash;who
was shot through the lungs and dying; and this mournful
tragedy was the sequel to the mere boyish joke of corking
a pair of mustaches on the lip of another, as he lay on the
mess-room chairs asleep overnight.
</p>

<p>
The officers were soon likely to have more of this sharp
work cut out for them; for Lieutenant Rowland Haystone,
of ours, a mere youth, having dined at the mess of a hussar
corps, they conveyed him, well dosed with champagne, into
the riding-school, and there carefully covering him up to the
nose in sawdust, left him, tucked in thus, to his slumbers, which
were undisturbed till the roughrider came with his horses
ard squad about seven next morning.  The non-commissioned
officer, astonished to see a man's face among the sawdust
and bark, dragged out our unfortunate subaltern, who had
some difficulty in comprehending where he was; and he
was brought home to his quarters in such a plight, that he
had a narrow escape from losing his commission.  To square
accounts, he shot one of the hussars; but, as the affair was
considered an insult to the whole regiment, the dragoons
and fusiliers fought whenever they met in the streets and
taverns, for some time after this, and Mr. Haystone actually
tabled at mess a proposal for calling out the whole of the
hussar officers by turns; but they were despatched to
join the Duke of York's unfortunate army in Flanders, and
so ended this feud and its follies.
</p>

<p>
Soon after this, I was detailed for a very unpleasant
duty.
</p>

<p>
A number of men being required for the West India fleet,
under Admiral Jervis, there came a secret order for the
press-gangs to visit the docks and crimping-houses at Hull;
and on the night selected by the authorities, fifty men of
the fusiliers, provided each with twenty rounds of
ball-cartridge, were paraded, about ten o'clock, under the
command of Lieutenant Haystone and Ensign Bruce, and
marched with great secrecy towards the principal dock, the
gates of which were by that time closed.  We were in
light-marching order, with our forage-caps and great-coats.
</p>

<p>
At the gate, we were joined by fifty carefully-selected
seamen, all armed with cutlasses and pistols, and wearing
short flushing jackets.  Among them, as I afterwards heard,
were a number of the oldest midshipmen, and the whole
body was officered by second and third lieutenants.  They
had already with them a few pressed men, whom they had
picked up at the grog-shops and ale-houses, as they came
along the quay, and these were easily discernible by their
hands being fettered and their sullen air.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Haystone now gave the commands to prime and load
with ball, and to fix bayonets; and on the gates being
opened, he took possession of the pressed men, and sent
guards, under sergeants or corporals, to keep the various
avenues, with orders to defend them at the point of the
bayonet against all who might attempt to escape or resist;
for such was the aversion to the naval service, even at this
time, when Nelson's pennant was streaming from the
<i>Victory</i>, that press-gangs frequently met with the most
desperate resistance: and at Hull, in those days, there
lived near the docks a certain enterprising son of the
Emerald Isle, who kept a large depôt of cudgels, and lent
them out, at "a penny a <i>row</i>," to all who required them.
</p>

<p>
All was still and dark in the docks, and I could see the
forest of masts and rigging standing in intricate masses
against the cloudy sky, which, fortunately for our
expedition, was moonless, and the month was October.
</p>

<p>
Dividing into numerous small parties, the press-gang
boarded several large ships; and from the quay we could
see the flashing of cutlass blades, and the gleam of lanterns
on the masts above and the slimy water below, and on the
pale and excited faces of the crews, as they were turned up
from their hammocks, and their skippers forced to account
for all their men, per list.  Their papers were cursorily
examined, and the best men selected for service.  On the
slightest resistance they were handcuffed, at the point of the
cutlass and the muzzle of the levelled pistol.
</p>

<p>
While posted as sentinel inside one of the gates, I saw a
fugitive seaman, who had dropped on the quay from the
spritsail yard of a large bark, run towards the barrier, and
heedless of my command to "fall back," he proceeded at
once, and with desperate activity, to climb up by the
crossbars of the gate, for the purpose of escaping.
</p>

<p>
Remembering all I had endured on board the <i>Tartar</i>, I
pitied the poor fellow; but my orders were imperative;
moreover, the eye of a sergeant was upon me.
</p>

<p>
"Come back, sirrah!" I exclaimed, cocking my musket;
"come back, or I shall be compelled to shoot you."
</p>

<p>
"Shoot away, then," he replied, and still continued to
climb.
</p>

<p>
I know not how I might have acted had not his foot
slipped when near the summit, and he fell heavily to the
ground.  Powerful and active, he sprang up at once, and
boldly confronted me as I charged my bayonet; and
perceiving that his intention was evidently to close with me
and wrest away my musket, I said, resolutely,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Stand!&mdash;stir not one step, or I shall shoot you down,
in the king's name!"
</p>

<p>
"Curse the king, and every slave who serves him!" he
exclaimed, with an oath, which, however dreadful, seemed
not unfamiliar to me; and, on drawing nearer, I recognized
the mean and sinister visage of Dick Knuckleduster, whom
I had last seen in the burning beacon.
</p>

<p>
"You were one of the keepers of the Sandbridge lighthouse?"
said I, with some satisfaction; for, to tell the
truth, the catastrophe of the beacon sometimes haunted me
unpleasantly.  He scowled at me under his shaggy eyebrows,
and did not reply.
</p>

<p>
"Answer!" said I, threatening him with my bayonet.
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;what if I was?"
</p>

<p>
"You know that it was burned down?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay&mdash;pretty well," he growled, with a laugh and an
imprecation.
</p>

<p>
"How did you escape?"
</p>

<p>
"By the water."
</p>

<p>
"Of course&mdash;but by what other means?"
</p>

<p>
"I swam."
</p>

<p>
"And Bill with the broken nose?"
</p>

<p>
"Was roasted like a crab, and like a buttered crab I
heard him sputtering on the burning beams above
me&mdash;ugh!&mdash;d&mdash;n me&mdash;burned alive!"
</p>

<p>
"And the wretched Jewess?"
</p>

<p>
"Mother Snatchblock?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Ha! ha! burned too; but who the devil are you, that
you know all this?" he added, savagely, while coming
forward.
</p>

<p>
"Back&mdash;back!" I exclaimed, "or I shall run my bayonet
into you; I am Oliver Ellis, the boy whom you would
have sold to the press-gang&mdash;do you hear me, rascal?&mdash;to the
press-gang, to whom I shall surrender you in five minutes
as a prisoner.  Time about is fair play, Mr. Dick
Knuckleduster."
</p>

<p>
For a few seconds the fellow was silent; and while our
eyes glared into each other, we could hear the bustle on
board the ships,&mdash;the breaking open of hatches,&mdash;voices
calling the rolls of crews,&mdash;the scuffles, oaths, and plunging
overboard of those who sought to escape the gang by
swimming to the quays, where they were captured by the
guards of fusiliers under Mr. Haystone.  In muscular
strength I was but a child, when compared to a ruffian so
brawny as Knuckleduster; but my position as sentinel, and
my loaded musket, gave me a power of life and death over
him.  He felt this; his features contracted with intense
ferocity, and I could see his sinister eyes glaring like those
of a polecat in the dark.
</p>

<p>
"What&mdash;here's our powder-monkey that bolted become
a full-blown lobster!" he exclaimed, with an affected laugh;
"but you'll shake hands, won't you, Oliver?"
</p>

<p>
"Back!" I replied, keeping my charged bayonet at his
breast; "back, for my finger is on the trigger."
</p>

<p>
"You will let me past, won't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Not an inch."
</p>

<p>
"I was very kind to you in that ere beacon, I was," said
the fellow, in a whining voice; "Bill wanted to shy you
into the water one night, to save your grog and biscuits;
but I thought it better&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"To sell me&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"To whom?"
</p>

<p>
"The press-gang, through Mother Snatchblock's respectable
agency, eh?&mdash;sell me like the emerald ring and jewels
of the unfortunate man, who was wrecked near the beacon,
whom you foully murdered, and whose body you sunk with
an old kedge-anchor, eh?&mdash;Knuckleduster, the wrecker, thief,
and murderer!"
</p>

<p>
He uttered a growl like a bulldog, and literally writhed
with fear and baffled rage as I said this.
</p>

<p>
"You have no proof for what you say, and I defy you,"
replied he; "but this I know, that I shall seize <i>you</i> as a
deserter&mdash;a boy run from His Majesty's ship <i>Tartar</i>, and
all your denials, or jawing fore and aft, won't be worth a
soldier's button.  Besides, how do I know that you didn't
burn that ere beacon, as well as steal Mother Snatchblock's
boat, and so become guilty of murder as well as robbery?
Oh!  I see jolly well you'll think better of it than let me
be taken to-night.  A fine joke it would be, indeed, for
Dick Knuckleduster to be beaten at this time o' day by a
sucking-turkey like you!"
</p>

<p>
"Silence, dog, or I shall certainly bayonet you.  I am no
longer the friendless boy you thought me, but one of the
Royal Fusiliers, and I defy alike your falsehoods and your
malevolence."
</p>

<p>
The fellow again resorted to the most abject entreaties
that I would permit him to escape; but I stood resolutely
then, pinning him against the wall, until Mr. Stanley, a
midshipman of the <i>Adder</i> frigate, approached with a party
of seamen, and pressed him into his Majesty's sea service.
Then, as they dragged him away, he poured forth a torrent
of imprecations upon me, mingled with threats of future
vengeance, which I heeded less than the chafing of the
slimy water upon the green and barnacled sides of the quay.
At all this the midshipman and the sailors only laughed,
saying they had "a boatswain, who would teach him better
manners, on board the <i>Adder</i>."
</p>

<p>
However, this was not the <i>last</i> I was fated to see of
Master Richard Knuckleduster.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVI.
<br><br>
THE ROUTE.
</h3>

<p>
The time was approaching now, when my comrades and
I would have "to go forth to meet the shadowy future
without fear and with manly hearts;" for orders came from
the Horse Guards that the regiment should be held in
readiness for foreign service in a tropical climate.  The
depôt was formed; kits were carefully inspected and
reduced.  The officers provided themselves with those suits
of white jean or linen, which our more limited means denied
the poor rank and file; but our lieutenant-colonel, the Earl
of Kildonan (who had returned to Scotland to be married),
was generous as he was brave and noble, and from his own
purse supplied the regiment with many necessary articles of
comfort which the niggard government we served withheld.
He gave to every man a white canvas frock, or fatigue dress,
for boardship, with a pint of port on the day the route came,
to drink the health of his young countess, which we all did,
with three cheers, in the barrack-yard of Kingston-upon-Hull,
and with joyous hearts; for a little kindness goes a
long way in the army, and no men's regard is more easily
won than that of soldiers.
</p>

<p>
I write from experience, for I know them <i>well</i>.  Every
soldier has a comrade, who brings his dinner when on duty,
or attends to his little wants when sick, for all these kind
offices are reciprocal; and it was my good fortune to find
one, than whom no better or braver fellow ever wore the
scarlet and blue of the old fusiliers.  This was honest Tom
Telfer, the same runaway lad whom Sergeant Drumbirrel
had concealed in the sack near Compton Rennel, and who
fell to my lot at Hull, under rather chivalrous circumstances,
though he was deemed a very raw recruit, and as such was
ordered to remain with the depôt.
</p>

<p>
When the order to prepare for foreign service came, it
stated that only two married women would be permitted to
go for every hundred men; and as we had many wives in the
fusiliers, the balloting caused serious anxiety in the barrack.
That it might be fairly and justly conducted in our company,
old Captain Glendonwyn, who had spent the best years of a
long life in the regiment, and was loved by us all, attended
in person.  Tickets in proportion to the number of married
women were put into Sergeant Drumbirrel's bearskin cap.
Two of these were marked "to go," the rest were blanks.
It was a heart-rending scene to witness the pale and
trembling women put in their hands, and lingeringly draw
forth the paper, which, when unfolded, made them perhaps
shriek and cast themselves on their husband's breast.  Poor
old Captain Glendonwyn said and did all that was possible
to console the disappointed and afflicted; but all proved
fruitless.  One woman, a drunken and worthless character,
detested by the whole company, uttered a loud and coarse
hurrah, adding,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Luck and ould Ireland for ever!"
</p>

<p>
She was Mahoney's wife, who had drawn a prize "to go,"
and all present exchanged glances of disappointment; for
"Mother Mahoney," as we named her, could very well have
been spared.
</p>

<p>
The next who advanced was a poor young English girl, a
lance-corporal's wife, in a few weeks to become a mother.
</p>

<p>
Thrice she put in her trembling hand, while her eyes were
closed, and her teeth clenched.  I looked at her husband.
Pale as death, the poor fellow was watching her with,
nervous anxiety.
</p>

<p>
"Take courage, my bairn," said Glendonwyn, who always
spoke Scotch, patting her kindly on the shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, sir, I need it sorely," said she.
</p>

<p>
The fatal paper was drawn forth, but she had not the
courage to open it; neither had her husband.
</p>

<p>
The captain gently took it from her hand and opened it.
The old man's kindly features fell.  He gave her a glance
full of commiseration, and shook his white head sorrowfully.
</p>

<p>
"My puir lassie!" said he.
</p>

<p>
"I am not to go?" she asked in a breathless voice.
</p>

<p>
"God comfort you, bairn; corporal, look to your wife," he
added hastily, as she sank back into the arms of the soldiers
who crowded round her.
</p>

<p>
On recovering, she begged and implored her husband,
hysterically and in moving terms, not to leave her, and her
yet unborn babe; but he&mdash;a soldier and under orders&mdash;what
had he to urge&mdash;what promise could he make, for he
was not a free man?  This scene was singularly painful, for
the young corporal and his little English wife were respected
by all the company.  While Captain Glendonwyn was
endeavouring to console them, one of those incidents ensued,
which, I rejoice to say, are not of unfrequent occurrence
in the service.  Tom Telfer stepped forward, and saluting
the captain said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Please, sir, because I was an awkward fellow, they
detained me for the depôt; but if you could get the corporal
turned over to it, I'll gladly volunteer, for his wife's sake,
to go in his place."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, my brave lad," said the old captain, clapping
him on the shoulder; "you are a credit to the regiment&mdash;I
will never forget you."
</p>

<p>
"Bless you, Tom Telfer&mdash;bless you&mdash;bless you!" cried
the young wife, throwing her arms round his neck and
kissing him on both cheeks in a transport of gratitude,
while her husband wrung his hand, and the soldiers gave
him three cheers.
</p>

<p>
The balloting was again resumed, and the other prizes "to
go," fell, as usual in such cases, to the lot of the worthless
and careless, too many of whom followed our corps in those
days.
</p>

<p>
Tom was transferred to the service companies, and I confess
to conceiving a great predilection for him, from the day
the balloting took place.
</p>

<p>
Next morning, an hour before daybreak, when a dull and
wetting mist was floating on the Humber, enveloping the
town, with its spires and docks, its quays and shipping, we
paraded in heavy marching order, with knapsacks packed,
our blankets, canteens, and havresacks hung about us, and
fell into our ranks, one thousand strong, for embarkation.
The muster-rolls were called by lantern light; but day
broke before the gates were flung open, and by that time
the parade-ground was crowded by soldiers of other corps,
who assembled to give us a farewell cheer, for we were bound
on distant and arduous service in the West India Isles, when
the republican principles, which in this and the preceding year
had deluged France with blood, were fast extending, and
where the Blacks and inhabitants of colour had risen in arms
against the Europeans, who now sought from Great Britain
that protection which the mother-country, plunged in civil
war and anarchy, was unable to afford them; but our mission
was also one of capture and conquest, in the fertile and
beautiful Antilles.
</p>

<p>
The handsome young Earl of Kildonan, our leader, looked
somewhat sad and pale on this morning; for, as we heard,
he had been recently married in Scotland, where he was
leaving behind a young and beautiful wife, who, however, as
he told us in his harangue, was to follow us and join him,
when we had captured the West India Isles from the French,
and made there a quiet home for a time.
</p>

<p>
The bayonets were fixed, and with a thousand bright
musket barrels, were glittering gaily in the morning light.
The colours were uncased&mdash;the blue colours of the Old
Fusileers, with the Thistle and Saint Andrew embroidered
on his cross; and now the band struck up "The Girl I left
behind Me," as we wheeled from line into sections, and the
loud hearty cheer that rang along the departing column
was responded to by all the spectators.  On this eventful
morning, I remember how the first <i>flam</i> of the leading
drum made my heart leap; I felt that I was now a soldier
in earnest!
</p>

<p>
"Cheer again, my lads," cried old Captain Glendonwyn,
brandishing his sword; "there is nothing in this world like
a hearty British cheer.  All the Frenchmen in Europe could
never make anything like it."
</p>

<p>
Amid the enthusiasm kindled in the eyes and hearts of
all, by the aspect of the fusileers with their long lines of
tall black bearskin caps and glittering bayonets, on the
march to a far and foreign land of war, disease and danger,
were many episodes of a sorrowful kind.  On all sides were
poor fellows seen taking farewell&mdash;a last farewell it proved
to many&mdash;of their wives and scarcely-conscious little ones;
and many a man started from the ranks to give one more
kiss to the pale cheek he might never press again, or to the
ruddy mouths of their children; and then waving his hand
with a backward glance, strode manfully and mournfully on,
with his shouldered musket.
</p>

<p>
"God bless you, Mary dear!" said one.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye, Elsie, my love; be carefu' o' the bairns till we
a' come back again."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, when will that be, Archy?"
</p>

<p>
"God only kens&mdash;I dinna."
</p>

<p>
"Kiss Robin and the wee pet every night for my sake;
pray for me often when I am far awa' frae you and hame,
Betsy, my bonnie doo!"
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah for the King and the old Twenty-first!  A
shilling a day is mighty fine pay!" shouted Corporal
Mahoney.
</p>

<p>
"Happy the man to-day who has no other wife than old
Brown Bess," I heard the earl say to Captain Glendonwyn.
</p>

<p>
Such were the scraps of conversation I heard on all sides,
amid the sobs and loud lamentations of women, who bore or
led their little ones by the hand, and strove to keep pace
with the sections in which their husbands marched, the
officers kindly permitting them to change place with the
outer files, that husband and wife&mdash;parent and child&mdash;might
keep together, hand-in-hand, till the last fatal moment of
separation.  As we neared the harbour and marched along
the quay of the old dock, which occupies the site of the
ancient walls and ramparts, and enters immediately from the
river Hull, the sailors in all the merchant shipping swarmed
up into the rigging to give us a parting cheer, and amid such
sounds, and the song sung by the mass of our light-hearted
fellows, the sorrow of those who were on the eve of
separation, perhaps for ever, was swept away or forgotten by the
beholders; and still with breathing brass and clashing
cymbal, "ear-piercing fife and spirit-stirring drum," our
band accompanied the sonorous chant of nearly three
hundred voices:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The dames of France are fair and free,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Flemish lips are willing;<br>
  And soft the maids of Italy,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Spanish eyes are thrilling:<br>
  Still though I bask beneath their smile,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their charms must fail to bind me,<br>
  For my heart flies back to Britain's isle,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>And the girl I left behind me!</i><br>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVII.
<br><br>
THE "ADDER" FRIGATE.
</h3>

<p>
We were to form part of an armament which consisted of
three line-of-battle ships, six frigates, and several transports,
under the command of Admiral Sir John Jervis, having on
board a body of troops of the line and artillery, under
General Sir Charles Grey, K.B., afterwards created Viscount
Howick, Earl Grey, and who was father of the great
political reformer and statesman.  Our express orders were
to attack and capture the French West Indian Islands,
considerable information regarding the military details of which
had been furnished to our government by Madame de
Rouvigny, a fugitive Royalist, who resided under the
protection of the British flag at Barbadoes.
</p>

<p>
The head-quarters of the fusiliers were on board the
<i>Adder</i>, a large double-banked frigate, and when stepping on
her deck, the first person who met me face to face was my
former terror and <i>bête noir</i>, Mr. Cranky, who was now
promoted to this command, in reward for the vigour with which
he had exerted himself when on board the <i>Tartar</i>.  He was
superintending the embarkation of the troops, whom he
surveyed with no very pleasant expression of face, and at
whom he swore roundly as they arrived in boat-loads; for
to a sublime contempt for landsmen in general, Captain
Cranky united a species of indescribable disgust for soldiers
in particular; thus he would as soon have received any
number of obnoxious vermin on board his frigate as the
head-quarter division of his Majesty's Scots Fusiliers.
</p>

<p>
On board this fleet were the 8th, or King's Regiment;
the 9th, 33rd, 38th, 43rd Light Infantry; 44th, 70th, or
Surrey; and other corps, led by officers, many of whom
were to attain titles and distinctions in the following wars
of the Peninsula and Flanders.  As we were proceeding on
service in time of war, we had all our full allowance of
ammunition; but each man was restricted to ten rounds,
the reserve being lodged in the ship's magazine.
</p>

<p>
As we were bound for a warm climate, large tubs were
fixed in the forecastle for our men to bathe in, and when
these could not be used, they drenched each other by
buckets of salt water.  This, if it promoted health and
cleanliness, often produced quarrels and rough practical
joking, and was, at times, particularly unpleasant; but such
compulsory ablutions are enjoined by the rules of the
service.  At eight every morning the hammocks were
brought on deck and triced in the nettings.
</p>

<p>
We sailed about the latter end of January, the admiral
having sent a frigate ahead to bring off some transports and
storeships that waited for us at Plymouth.  We encountered
adverse winds, and nearly a fortnight elapsed ere the frigate
appeared, with St. George's cross flying at her maintopmasthead,
upon which, the ships destined for the expedition
weighed and stood under canvas, out of the sound.  On
this day the <i>Spitfire</i>, sloop-of-war, joined us, with her colours
half-hoisted.  Her commander, James Cooke, son of the
celebrated navigator, had been drowned, with his coxswain
and seven seamen, by the oversetting of his boat.  It is
remarkable that his second brother perished in the <i>Thunderer</i>,
74, when she foundered in a storm, and that his two
sisters were married to naval officers, both of whom were
drowned.
</p>

<p>
I well remember the horrors of sea-sickness in the Bay of
Biscay, when we encountered an adverse gale.
</p>

<p>
The whole squadron were signalled as being in sight when
we reached latitude 49.40; and then we bore away for
Barbadoes.  The ships kept as near each other as was
consistent with safety; thus scarcely a day elapsed without a
friendly cheer being exchanged between the <i>Adder</i> and
other vessels of the fleet; and twice we were within a
pistol-shot of the <i>Spitfire</i>, which bore the left wing of our
regiment.
</p>

<p>
As we got into warmer latitudes, the sentinels, who at
sea mount guard with their bayonets only, were strictly
enjoined to prevent men from sleeping on deck, as it is
productive of fever, moon-blindness and other ailments;
and twice in each week we had fumigations of common salt,
oxide of manganese, sulphuric acid, and water, placed in
basins or pipkins of hot sand between decks.  I have to
apologize for troubling the reader with details, perhaps, so
trivial; but such were new to me then, and served to lighten
the tedium of a long voyage in a crowded frigate.
</p>

<p>
One night the wind blew hard, while torrents of rain
fell.  In the obscurity we could neither see the lantern of
the admiral's ship, nor hear the guns she fired.  Once I
thought a faint gleam lighted the darkness far away to
leeward; but my observation was treated as valueless by
the sailors, because it came from a red coat.  On this night
I was sentinel before the poop, and the disastrous incident
that occurred impressed the memory of it upon me.
</p>

<p>
The atmosphere was so thick that Captain Cranky, who,
with all his coarseness and tyranny, was an able and skilful
seaman, ordered the watches to be doubled, a light to be
shown at the foremast truck, and one at each end of the
spritsail yard, while a constant look-out was kept ahead,
lest we might run foul of some of our own transports.  The
wind increased so much, that the sails were reduced; but
still the <i>Adder</i>, a sharply-built frigate, was flying fast
through the water, which swept past her on each side like a
millrace, curling in white foam under her counter, and
bubbling far away in the waste of darkness and obscurity
astern.
</p>

<p>
Still the gale increased, and now the spray flew in
showers across our deck.  The huge lanterns swung madly
to and fro at their perches, casting many a wavering gleam
on the tall and spectral outline of the frigate's canvas, and
on her wetted rigging.  The ports were all closed; more
sail was taken off the ship, and then the deadlights were
battened in.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly a cry came from the watch forward.
</p>

<p>
"A sail&mdash;ho!"
</p>

<p>
"Where?" cried the officer in command of the deck.
</p>

<p>
"Right ahead, sir."
</p>

<p>
Ere another word could be said, there was a shock&mdash;a
yell as if from the bosom of the sea, and with a mighty
crash we were upon her!
</p>

<p>
I sprang upon the poop, and saw ahead, two tottering
masts sink like phantoms under our lee bow, and in another
instant, the wreck of a brig we had cleft in two, was swept
past me, and sank astern.  I saw a few miserable men,
half naked, or just as they had sprung from bed, clinging
to the tophamper, while the crushed and shattered hull
went down into the trough of the midnight sea, and from
its dark and horrid valley, their cries of death and despair
rose mournfully to the lofty poop, from whence I surveyed
them.
</p>

<p>
All this was but the vision of a moment, for the howling
blast which hurried us on, swept the wreck, and the poor
wretches who floated about it, alike out of sight and
hearing.
</p>

<p>
"Lay the foreyard to the wind&mdash;officer of the watch!
''Sdeath where is the officer of the watch?" bellowed
Captain Cranky, through his trumpet, as he rushed on
deck; "pipe away the cutter&mdash;over with the life-buoys&mdash;up
with more lanterns!"
</p>

<p>
The <i>Adder</i> was under such way, that some time elapsed
before she could be put about; but as boats could not be
lowered in such a sea, Cranky was obliged to content
himself with firing guns, and burning blue lights, amid
the haze and gusty wind of that gloomy and mournful
night.
</p>

<p>
We hovered about the place for an hour: but all was
silent, save the voice of the wind, which howled through
the rigging, and tore the foamy crests off the billows as they
rose above the line of the sea.  Of that doomed ship, we
saw and heard no more.
</p>

<p>
The next day dawned clear and beautiful; but the sea
was swept by glasses in vain for a trace of the wreck.
Indeed we were then far from the scene of the catastrophe,
which was the source of much ill-feeling between Captain
Cranky, and the Earl of Kildonan, the former asserting
that "but for the blundering stupidity of some of his
blubberly Scotsmen, who formed part of the forecastle watch,
and failed to keep a proper look-out, the collision would
never have occurred."
</p>

<p>
The Earl, who was proud, fiery, and high-spirited,
resented the overbearing manner, the coarseness and tyranny
of Captain Cranky; thus bitter words ensued between
them&mdash;so bitter that we were certain a duel would follow
as soon as we came in sight of land anywhere.
</p>

<p>
Cranky ordered two of our men to be flogged, as he would
have done seamen, on his own authority.  The Earl insisted
that, as soldiers, they should first be tried by a court martial.
Upon this, the captain stuck his old battered cocked hat
(the hue of which had long since become brick red by exposure
to the brine) fiercely over his solitary eye, and while it
glared like that of a cobra capello, he folded his arms, and
spluttered out,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"D&mdash;n my eyes and limbs, my lord, or whatever you call
yourself, do you or I command this ship?"
</p>

<p>
"Sir," replied the Earl loftily, and with a disdainful
smile; "the rules of the service say, that when troops are on
board of ship, the entire command will be vested in the
senior officer; whatever branch of the service he may
belong to, he is equally bound to exercise that command,
and is responsible for any breach of discipline that may
occur."
</p>

<p>
"So, sir, a King's ship might come to be commanded by a
puppy of a hussar or lancer, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"It might be so," said Kildonan, laughing.
</p>

<p>
The very idea of this, made Cranky almost choke with
spleen; he thundered out a terrible oath, and swore he would
lash every Fusileer who was on deck that night; for when
soldiers are on board ship, they are divided into three
watches, one of which, with a subaltern officer, must be
constantly on deck, to assist in keeping a look-out, and to work
the running rigging.  This proposal to flog about one
hundred-and-fifty men made the Earl laugh aloud; but he
added gravely,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Beware, sir, for this language and bearing cannot be
tolerated.  If you proceed thus, I shall be forced to take
strong measures, and at the point of the bayonet, make a
signal to the nearest ship of the fleet; beware, sir, I am
Henry, Earl of Kildonan, and Lieutenant-Colonel of the
Scots Fusileers."
</p>

<p>
"Signal&mdash;a signal from my ship and without <i>my</i> orders?"
exclaimed Cranky, absolutely livid and dancing with rage;
"I'll let you know, sirrah, a lousy Scots lord, thof you be,
that I value your title and your laced coat at about as much
as they are worth.  Beat to quarters," he added, with the
voice of a stentor, while rushing into his cabin, from whence
he returned with a couple of swords; "beat to quarters and
man the main-deck guns!"
</p>

<p>
It was now the young Earl's turn to change colour, and he
glanced anxiously at Glendonwyn, Colepepper, Haystone, and
several of his officers, who drew near him.  By this time the
drum had beaten, the whole of the fusileers were on deck,
and seemed only to be waiting for orders to rush below,
and snatch their muskets from the cleats, as a conflict
seemed impending between them and the crew of the <i>Adder</i>,
who, though by no means devoted to their furious commander,
repaired to their stations with doubt, irresolution, and
sullenness, expressed in all their faces; for, although these
men were ready to oppose any foe, muzzle to muzzle, they
were by no means inclined to grapple with their own
countrymen, to gratify the fury of a half-tipsy tyrant.
</p>

<p>
Cranky now ordered every officer and man down to the
guns on the main deck, and requested the Earl to send the
Fusileers below.
</p>

<p>
Lord Kildonan complied, and in a moment not a man was
left on the poop deck save two seamen at the wheel, and
the sentinel.  I had the good fortune to be the latter.
</p>

<p>
"Choose one of these swords, sir," said Cranky, "and
stand on your defence.  I'll teach you, lord and earl thof ye
be, that I command this ship."
</p>

<p>
Kildonan took one of the swords, on which Cranky
instantly unsheathed the other, crying,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"On guard, on guard, or whiz? damme.  I am through
you."
</p>

<p>
"Captain Cranky," said the Earl, with stern dignity;
"I would beg of you to remember that I am, probably, a much
better swordsman than you, having had the misfortune to
be some years a prisoner of war in France, where, having a
good <i>maître d'armes</i>, I had little else to occupy my leisure
hours, than the use of the small sword&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What the devil is all this to me?" asked Cranky.
</p>

<p>
"Simply this, sir; that if you are determined to fight, I
will meet you with pistols on shore, when we shall be on
more equal terms."
</p>

<p>
"You Scotch swab of a lord; you&mdash;you are a lubberly
coward and dare not fight.  'Sblood, I'll have you carried to
the main deck and drenched with buckets of bilge water&mdash;I
will; or towed over-board at the end of a line; on
guard&mdash;on guard," he added, making a vicious thrust.
</p>

<p>
The Earl grew deadly pale.
</p>

<p>
"Fellow," said he, "you must be either mad or drunk to
address in such terms one who is a peer of the realm, and
Colonel in his Majesty's service."
</p>

<p>
He now stood on the defensive with his sword, which he
evidently used with great skill, though the manner in which
Cranky lunged and hewed away like a man flailing corn,
was sufficiently perplexing.  Meanwhile, the faces of the
fusileers were seen peeping above the hatchway-coamings
round which the shot lay, and the seamen at the guns on
the main deck stood like statues, surveying in wonder a
scene never before witnessed on the poop of a man-of-war.
</p>

<p>
Kildonan's coolness so bitterly exasperated the choleric
captain, that making one violent lunge he overthrust
himself, and in falling on the earl's sword, received a deep
wound in the breast.  He fell heavily on the deck, while a
terrible oath, and a deluge of blood left his lips together.
</p>

<p>
Rendered more mad than ever by this catastrophe, and
choking in blood and rage, as the earl bent over him, Cranky
snatched a pistol from his belt, and would have shot him
through the head; but I saw the action, and quick as
thought sprang forward and knocked aside the weapon
with my bayonet.  The pistol exploded; the ball grazed
Lord Kildonan's left ear, and struck a splinter off the
mainyard.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, Ellis, my good lad," said he calmly; "I believe
that I owe my life to you, and I shall not forget the debt."
</p>

<p>
The report of the pistol brought all who were below,
seamen, soldiers, and marines, swarming up the hatches on
deck, and the captain was borne senseless to his cabin, and
placed under the doctor's care.
</p>

<p>
This was a singular scene to be enacted on the poop of
one of His Majesty's frigates; but I am writing of the
year 1794, when there were to be found occasionally in the
service, such officers as Smollet has portrayed, under the
name of Captain Oakham and, indeed, old Cranky was
usually known in the fleet of Admiral Jervis by that
cognomen.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVIII.
<br><br>
LAND!
</h3>

<p>
After this affair we all got on pleasantly enough; to the
great satisfaction of the crew, the choleric captain was
confined to his cabin, and the ship was commanded by
Mr. Percival, the first-lieutenant.  Few other incidents of
interest occurred during the outward voyage, which by various
delays, lasted about three months; for until we felt the
influence of the trade wind, which seldom varies throughout
the year&mdash;the same wind which, by its steadiness, excited
the terror of the seamen of Columbus&mdash;we encountered very
foul weather.
</p>

<p>
After a time, the wonders of the deep&mdash;the showers of
flying-fish, the brown droves of shining porpoises surging
through the sea&mdash;leaping as it were, from one watery slope
to another&mdash;the huge whale rising up suddenly like an
inverted ship, with the water pouring in a torrent from its
slippery sides, spouting foam, or tossing its mighty tail in
the air; the blue shark gliding stealthily along under the
glossy surface of the calm sea, all ceased to excite interest,
and the intense monotony of the voyage, together with the
dull routine of duty, wearied me: thus, I can well recal
the joy I felt, when one morning, about the end of April,
Tom Telfer, who had been on the morning watch, pointed
out to me, a number of strange birds, that were hovering
among the far scattered ships of the fleet, while pieces of
sugar-cane, melon and other tropical indications of the
shore, floated past from time to time&mdash;a joy, only equalled
by the disappointment I endured, when after a sudden cry
of "land in sight," from the look-out man in the
main-crosstrees, a low dark stripe was declared to be "only Cape
Flyaway," which was slowly exhaled into the meredian sky,
and melted without leaving a trace behind.
</p>

<p>
We were driven to the 40th degree of north latitude, and
saw the volcanic hills of the Azores.  I remember when at
Guadaloupe, finding in a house when on a foraging party
a curious history of the discovery of these isles, by Gonsalvo
Velio, in 1449, in which there was a quaint and Gothic
story of this adventurous voyager, perceiving the figure of
a warrior on horseback on the summit of a rock overlooking
the sea.  "His left hand was on his horse's mane, and his
right hand pointed to the west."
</p>

<p>
Startled on beholding such an apparition in a desolate
island, Gonsalvo landed, and the figure was found to have
turned into stone, and certain cabalistic characters were
graven on the face of the rock before it.
</p>

<p>
We ran pretty close to St. Michael, the isle of oranges
and most eastern of the group; and then, with all the fleet
that were in sight, bore up for the island of Barbadoes, our
point of rendezvous.
</p>

<p>
Ere this, I had already reaped a portion of the fruit of
my steadiness, and attention to duty since my enlistment,
and also of the good education bestowed upon me, by my
kind mother, from whom I was now so far, far away.
</p>

<p>
"Once in the ranks&mdash;always in the ranks is the maxim
of the British army," says a writer in 1857, who knows
little about the matter; "a man who accepts the shilling
from the recruiting sergeant, and fulfils an engagement
made over his ale in a pot-house, bids adieu to all hope
of raising in the military profession; he must give up all
ambition, and seek what pleasure he can find in transient
indulgences."
</p>

<p>
Even in the old times of which I write, we did not find
ourselves thus degraded in the Scots Fusiliers; at least
I&mdash;Oliver Ellis&mdash;found it otherwise, for old Captain
Glendonwyn, after discovering my few qualifications, made me
useful in keeping the books of his company; and the reader
must remember that in those days of practical soldiering,
very few non-commissioned officers could read or write.  I
could do both, and had also a smattering of French and
Latin.  Thus, I was considered a species of military
prodigy; and when a fever, which broke out in the fleet on
its reaching warmer latitudes, swept off several of our
sergeants, I was promoted to one of the vacant halberts, and
my heart expanded with hope, joy, and ambition, when Lord
Kildonan, who, of course, remembered how I had saved him
from Cranky's pistol, told me earnestly to continue to
conduct myself with care, "and I might yet wear a pair of
epaulettes as my father had done before me."
</p>

<p>
The deaths were so frequent, as to cast a permanent
gloom over all on board; and I still recall the emotions of
awe and repugnance, with which I saw each poor corse
corded up in blankets and, with a cold shot at its heels,
consigned to a grave in the brine, through which the sharks
followed us with voracious obstinacy.
</p>

<p>
On the 3rd of March we saw land in earnest, and with
three hearty cheers that rang from ship to ship, we hailed
the fertile shores of Barbadoes.
</p>

<p>
As the fleet drew near, the undulating line of the island
rose gradually from the deep resplendent blue of the
Carribean sea, presenting an aspect of that surpassing verdure
and fertility to be found in the tropics alone.  The tall
sugar-canes were swaying in the soft breeze that came from
the ocean, and the groves of the plaintains, guavas,
pineapples, orange, lime, and citron trees, all in their varied
tints of green foliage and golden fruit, bounding flat green
lawns or shading little villages, above which the sugar-mills
were tossing their fanlike arms, made Barbadoes a charming
scene to eyes that had gazed so long upon the changeless
waste of sea and sky.
</p>

<p>
We ran into Carlisle Bay, and on Admiral Jervis's ship
firing a gun, the whole fleet came to anchor in three lines;
the courses were handed and the yards squared, while
crowds of black-skinned and woolly-headed negroes came
running out of the plantations to the shore to gaze at us;
and numbers came off from the little bights and creeks
in their piraguas or canoes, offering for sale pine-apples at a
penny each, guavas, bananas, and monkeys to suck, (<i>i.e.</i>,
cocoanuts filled with rum).  The <i>Adder</i>, with the head-quarters of
the Fusileers, was the leading frigate of the leeward line, so
we were less than a mile from the shore.
</p>

<p>
A boat was lowered at once to order various stores requisite
for the ship.  As it splashed into the water, I envied
the middy who was to be the first that trod on terra firma.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Mr. Stanley," cried Percival the first lieutenant as
he shoved off; "look out that your boat's crew don't suck
the monkey, or by Heaven, youngster, I'll mast-head you for
four-and-twenty hours."
</p>

<p>
On this day the captain appeared on deck for the first
time since his duel.  Lord Kildonan hastened to offer the
assistance of his arm; which Cranky accepted with a better
grace than we could have anticipated, but now their feud
was at an end.
</p>

<p>
Now, my first thought was of <i>home</i>.  How I longed
to write the story of my long and tedious voyage; to ask
forgiveness and a blessing from those I had left behind; but
a knowledge of the difficulty which even officers experienced
in the transmission of their letters in those days, made me
cast aside, in a species of despair, the pen I had assumed,
and I sought to forget my bitterness of heart in gazing on
the green shore, and anticipating a release from the thraldom
of the frigate.
</p>

<p>
An emotion of repugnance and alarm, thrilled through
me, on seeing the number of sharks that played about in
Carlisle bay.  To me, it seemed as if all the sharks in the
ocean were swarming in that small bight of deep blue water.
The sailors averred that "they nosed the soldiers aboard,"
and knew well when a ship was crowded.  One fact is
certain, that they were wont to follow the slave-ships hither
from the Guinea coast; and as deaths were frequent on
board of such filthy and crowded craft, a day seldom passed
without a body being tossed overboard, and we could see it
rent to pieces under our eyes by those voracious monsters of
the deep&mdash;for many slave-ships had come in under convoy
and lay at anchor to leeward of the fleet; to windward,
would not be tolerated.
</p>

<p>
In a very old folio history of Barbadoes, I remember my
comrade, Tom Telfer, reading to me once, when sick in my
hammock, the following singular episode concerning a shark
in Carlisle Bay.
</p>

<p>
In the reign of Queen Anne, an old brig, of quaint aspect,
high-pooped and low-waisted, named the <i>York Merchant</i>,
Captain Jack Beams, commander, a letter-of-marque, pierced
for ten guns, besides pateraroes (for, in those days, the
Indian seas and the Florida Gulf were full of buccaniers)
arrived at Barbadoes from England, and landed a cargo in
Carlisle Bay.  The warmth of the weather, together with
the delightful blue of the deep water, tempted one of the
seamen to leap overboard and bathe; but he was scarcely
three fathoms from the ship, when there was a cry raised
on board:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Look out&mdash;ware shark!" and an enormous blue one
was seen, slowly but surely, with the wake of its body
shining under the surface, to shoot towards him.
</p>

<p>
A sailor, who had a great regard for the luckless swimmer,
as they were old friends and messmates, sprang into a boat
alongside, and pushed off to his assistance; but the shark
was quicker than he, and he arrived in time only to see the
monster open its dreadful jaws, and cut fairly in two the
body of his friend, as he raised himself shrieking from the
bloody water.  All the man below the waist was swallowed
by the shark at a mouthful.  The remainder was brought
on board, to the horror and dismay of the crew.  For more
than an hour after this the insatiable shark was seen slowly
swimming round the ship (against the sides of which the
water rippled in bloody tints), as if waiting for the other
half of his victim.
</p>

<p>
Many a musket-shot was discharged at him, but he
escaped them all.
</p>

<p>
Enraged by this tenacity and temerity, the messmate of
the dead man swore that he would have vengeance; and
throwing off his clothes, ere he could be prevented, sprang
into the water, armed with a long and sharp-pointed
dagger, which he had lashed to his right hand by a lanyard.
Even before his white body had risen to the surface, the
shark was seen by the ship's crew, making slowly towards
him, and they clambered into the rigging and ran out upon
the studding-sail booms, where they gazed in breathless
astonishment on a combat so unusual and terrific.
</p>

<p>
At the moment when the shark opened his dreadful jaws,
the seaman, with a shout of triumph, dived below, and while
grasping the monster's upper fin with his left hand, gave
him three stabs in the belly with the dagger which armed
his right.
</p>

<p>
Rendered furious on finding himself so skilfully combated
in his own element, the shark plunged to the bottom,
leaving the water crimsoned with blood and froth.
</p>

<p>
Once again he rose to the surface, and again the brave
English mariner attacked him in the same manner, and
repeated his stabs, until so much blood and foam covered
the water, that the scared crew of the <i>York Merchant</i> knew
not which had the victory&mdash;the man or the giant-fish,&mdash;until
they saw the dead carcass floating, like an inverted
canoe, on the surface of the bay, when they hoisted their
ensign, fired off their all pateraroes, and hailed the victor
with three hearty cheers; thereafter, adds this quaint old
book, he "by the help of an ebbing tide, drags the shark
on shore, rips up his bowels, and unites and buries the
severed carcass of his friend in one hospitable grave, on the
shore of Carlisle Bay."
</p>

<p>
The evening on which we came to anchor there was
beautiful; but a succession of such evenings soon ceases to
excite comment in the tropics.
</p>

<p>
The round windsails rigged down every open hatchway,
white and swelling, were conveying the cool fresh air into
the deepest recesses of the frigate.  Her ports triced up,
gave, on one side, glimpses of cool and shady lime and
orange groves; on the other, the colder blue of the
Carribean Sea; yet the carronades, when one touched
them, felt hot beneath the hand, for the burning heat of
the breathless day that had passed, yet lingered about
them.  Alongside, the water rippled gently under the bends;
and more than every minute, the dark fin of the blue
shark&mdash;in those seas the most terrible of all its
species&mdash;rose above the surface of the clear, deep water.
</p>

<p>
The sweep of Carlisle Bay, so named from the Earl of
Carlisle, who obtained from Charles I. a grant of Barbadoes,
as "absolute proprietor and lord of the Caribee isles," with
the aspect of the capital, occupied me for some time, though
the view was, perhaps, more pleasing than striking.  It is
named Bridgetown, from a bridge that once spanned a
river which flowed into the bay, but which was choked or
dried up before 1715.  The British flag, always a pleasant
feature in a foreign land, as it tells so much of home and
safety, was flying above the Garrison,&mdash;an extensive range of
edifices, at the southern horn of the bay; while the northern
is occupied by a battery, the guns of which, peered over a
ridge of low coral reefs, whereon the sea was breaking in
white foam that sparkled in the light of the setting
sun.  Beyond, lay Fontabelle, of old the seat of the
governors, embosomed among tall cocoanut-trees, the tufted
heads of which were tossing their branches on the evening
wind.
</p>

<p>
Sugar-mills, with huge revolving fans, and rows of giant
cabbage-trees, broke the wavy sky-line; and from a distance,
came, at times, the cheerful but guttural chant of the
slimy-skinned and woolly-headed negroes, whose sole
garments were, usually, a pair of white or yellow cotton
breeches.  On the wharfs, gangs of them were busy, under
the sharp eye and sharper lash of overseers (attired in
spotless white, with broad-leaved hats) hoisting or stowing
sugars and other goods on board the shipping at the
carenage and mole.
</p>

<p>
Next day most of the troops were disembarked.  Some
were placed under canvas at a part of the isle which, being
mountainous, is named Scotland; a few were billeted, but
the Fusileers had the good fortune to be placed in the
garrison at Needham's Point, where Fort Charles, so named by
exiled Cavaliers in honour of the first monarch of that name,
was built in the days of old.
</p>

<p>
One requires to undergo the tedium of a long voyage to
feel the joy of first stepping ashore.
</p>

<p>
"Now, here we are in the West Indies again, boys!" I
heard some of our men shout as we marched along the
shore; "now for potted missionary, pickled monkey,
sangaree, brown girls, red rum, and yellow fever!"
</p>

<p>
"The mountains all sugar&mdash;the rivers all rum."
</p>

<p>
"Hot marches, mouldy biscuits, yams, and rattlesnakes,
plunder and prize-money."
</p>

<p>
So the thoughtless fellows continued amid reckless laughter
(though those islands were literally the grave of Europeans),
while they retired to their barracks, in which they were to
remain until Sir Charles Grey made his arrangements for
beating up the quarters of M. de Rouvigny, the French <i>chef
de bataillon</i>, who commanded in Martinique.
</p>

<p>
A rabble of every hue accompanied us to the gates of the
their faces exhibiting every variety, from the
sable negro of Sierra Leone, to the blanched pallor of the
sickly English Creole, whose countenance suggested nothing
but miasma, yellow fever, and the grave.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIX.
<br><br>
THE SNAKE.
</h3>

<p>
I remember with what delight, in the intervals of duty,
I rambled about this fertile and populous island, feeling as if
I could never enjoy sufficiently my emancipation from the
thraldom and confinement of a ship-of-war, crowded by
soldiers, seamen, marines, and stores, for a hostile expedition.
</p>

<p>
The whole fleet yet lay anchored in three lines in Carlisle
Bay, hoisting in fresh water and provisions; thus scores of
smart men-o'-war boats were incessantly arriving at, or
departing from, the mole and carenage at Bridgetown,
preparing for our departure to Martinique.  Armed ships
and batteries guarded the coast as a protection against
French privateers and Spanish pirates, a few of whom still
prowled in the West-Indian seas.
</p>

<p>
One evening I was returning from the town with the
order-book of my company, having been sent on duty to
Mr. Haystone, who had quartered himself there in a snug
lodging which he preferred to the garrison.
</p>

<p>
The beauty of the evening, the deep blue of the sky; and
the deeper blue of the sea, caused me to deviate from the
direct path for the garrison; and thus, leaving the road to
Needham's Point, I wandered for some miles inland, through
groves of yams, plaintains, and bananas, and frequently
through deep, narrow dells rent and riven, by volcanic
agency, where the sea found inlet and the brown tortoise
crawled, and where the rocks were covered by those bearded
figtrees from which this isle of hurricanes was named los
Barbados by the Spaniards in the olden time.
</p>

<p>
In other places, the tracts of table-land were covered by
the sugar-cane like a sea of wavy green, broken here and
there by avenues of lofty cabbage-trees, which led to the villas
of proprietors, or to their mills, where the slaves toiled for
the production of wealth.
</p>

<p>
In one of these shady walks I sat for a time, to reflect on
the wayward fortune which had cast me in this new land.
The air was very still, and had now become oppressive.
After a long train of negroes and asses, bearing the sugar of
some wealthy planter to the Bridge, had passed me, no sound
broke the stillness save the "drowsy hum" of the large
black bees depositing their honey in the trunk of an old
cotton-tree; the coo of the turtle-dove in the orange grove,
or the rustle made by the keen and glancing eyed racoon,
as it sprang from branch to branch of the cabbage-tree, or
the palmetto-royal above me.
</p>

<p>
I felt all the lassitude of the passed day; a drowsiness
was coming over me, but a dread of the scorpions that lurked
among the luxuriant grass, and of those great beetle-like
insects which are sure to bite sleepers till the blood comes,
made me struggle to repress it; moreover, I knew all the
dangers incident to sleeping under the descending dew,&mdash;fever,
ague, and so forth.  I arose, and was about to start on
my return to garrison, from which I was now some miles
distant, when a voice&mdash;a soft and sweet female voice&mdash;singing
in French, and quite near, made me pause and listen with
an undefinable emotion of pleasure; for it was long since I
had heard a voice so seducing and so tenderly modulated;
and it made me think of one whom I had now almost
forgotten&mdash;my little Amy Lee.
</p>

<p>
The singer, though not twenty paces from me, was
concealed by the luxuriant flowers and shrubbery that grew
under the cabbage-trees.  But the song ceased with singular
abruptness, and then, after a brief pause, followed a
half-stifled cry, ending in a heavy sob.
</p>

<p>
Alarmed by such a sound, and curious to see the singer, I
hastened towards her, and beheld a very remarkable, if not a
terrible scene.
</p>

<p>
A lady whose dark eyes and hair corroborated the idea
which her song suggested, that she was French, was seated
on the gnarled root of a cabbage-tree; but seemingly
paralysed and frozen with terror, for her eyes were fixed on
some object, which, at first sight, I was unable to discern.
I addressed her, but she did not reply.  I would have
spoken again, but the power of utterance was denied me, on
perceiving, not six feet distant from her, a huge rattlesnake,
with its fiery eyes, that seemed lighted by sparks from hell,
glaring into hers, while its wavy form glided forward by an
almost imperceptible motion, and its tail was raised up&mdash;always
significant of rage, for then the hollow horny substance
with which that appendage is furnished rattles at every
motion of the body.
</p>

<p>
The dark eyes of the French girl&mdash;she did not seem more
than two-and-twenty&mdash;were dilated with horror, her face
was deadly pale, her teeth were clenched, and her small
white hands clutched the grass among which she was seated.
On one side lay the broad round hat which had fallen from
her head; on the other lay her parasol, and a book she had
been reading when surprised by this terrible apparition.  I
glanced wildly round for some long weapon wherewith to
arm me, but in vain.
</p>

<p>
An instant, and all would be over!
</p>

<p>
Wrath and hate, like those of a fiend, seemed to swell the
flattened head, to fire the protruding orbs, and redden the
flamelike tongue of this hideous and terrific reptile, the
venom of which, when inserted in its victim by the two
long fangs that protrude from the upper jaw, is more
virulent and deadly than the poison of any other of its
dreadful species.
</p>

<p>
Pale as a dead woman, and deprived alike of volition,
energy&mdash;almost of thought&mdash;the poor girl gazed on her
coming destroyer as if she already felt its poison shooting
through her young veins.
</p>

<p>
I, too, was trembling with terror, and for a moment knew
not what to do; but the conviction that I must attempt to
save her, or feel myself a branded coward for life, made me
act with a decision the recollection of which excites my
astonishment even now.  I sprang forward, and, regardless
of the dreadful fate that might befall me, grasped the serpent
fiercely by the neck, and whirled it round my head with
such vigour, that it had not time to bite me; and I dashed it
with such tremendous force against the trunk of a cabbage-tree,
that it lay still with its eyes glancing upward like two
bright carbuncles, and its tail rattling nervously as it
whipped and lashed the earth.
</p>

<p>
Placing my left foot upon its head, I crushed it furiously
down into the soft earth, and hewed at the body with my
sword until it was cut into as many pieces as there were
joints in its tail.  The dreadful danger I had run in achieving
this victory, animated me by a kind of frenzy, and I
continued to slash at the writhing fragments of the snake till
my sword-arm grew weary.
</p>

<p>
On turning to her I had saved, she was lying still and
motionless in a heavy swoon.
</p>

<p>
Raising her in my arms, I bore her to where a little
runnel gurgled over a rock, among the luxuriant passion-flowers,
and there, undoing the upper portion of her dress,
laved her face and neck, her arms and shoulders, with the
water, which was very cool, as it trickled under the shadow
of the large green leaves; and while she slowly recovered,
I had time to perceive how delicately she was formed, and
how singularly beautiful she was.
</p>

<p>
Blanched by the terror she had undergone, her features
were like alabaster.  Her slender throat, her curved
shoulders, and the full round swell of her bosom, surpassed
all I had ever seen; and her fine dark hair, how black it
seemed, by very contrast, as it fell in wavy masses over
them.  Above her temples it had a curl in each thick
braid&mdash;whether by art or nature I know not.  Her eyes
were closed; and from the white and veined lid of each, a
long thick fringe of the darkest brown was gummed by tears
upon her cheek.  I could feel her heart beating through the
folds of her thin white muslin dress as animation slowly
returned.
</p>

<p>
I was little more than eighteen; and while holding her
in my arms, and laving the water about her bosom, the
consciousness that she&mdash;this girl so fair and beautiful&mdash;owed
life to me, filled all my heart with ardour, pride,
and joy.
</p>

<p>
How the huge reptile I had slain found its way into the
island, unless among the ballast or cargo of a South-American
ship, we could never discover, as in Barbadoes there are few
snakes more than three feet long; and even these are so
harmless that the superstitious negroes were wont to
respect, and at times to worship them.  It is related that a
negro, having slain one, was soon after afflicted by a
rheumatic pain in his arm; this he believed to be a punishment
inflicted on him by the Obi-man for doing so; and ever
after it was his custom to feed all the snakes that came near
his hut, and to place food in such spots as these reptiles
were known to frequent.
</p>

<p>
On the lady recovering, she began to address me in French,
but with great incoherence, and while clinging to my arm;
and it was not until after the lapse of several minutes, and
I had pointed repeatedly with my sword to the hacked
fragments of the snake, she could understand fully that she
was rescued, and by me.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, monsieur, how shall I ever be able to thank you for
the courage with which you have saved me from a dreadful
death?  Oh, monsieur, tell me&mdash;what shall I say&mdash;what do?
How pour out my thanks to you&mdash;my blessings on you&mdash;a
thousand and a thousand more good prayers and dear
wishes shall ever follow you!  Speak," she continued, with
true French volubility; "speak to me, and say who and
what you are?"
</p>

<p>
While she clung to my arm and poured this forth in the
purest French, pressing my hands to her heart, and casting
her earnest and beautiful eyes upward to mine, I felt greatly
bewildered, and endeavoured to calm her.
</p>

<p>
"Who are you?" she asked, for the third time.
</p>

<p>
"What my uniform declares me to be, madame,"
said I.
</p>

<p>
"A British soldier?"
</p>

<p>
"A sergeant in the Scottish regiment of fusiliers."
</p>

<p>
"A sergeant!  Monsieur seems quite a youth."
</p>

<p>
"I am an unfortunate gentleman, madame."
</p>

<p>
"Mon Dieu!"
</p>

<p>
"A strange destiny has cast me into the same ranks
which my father once commanded; but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But what?"
</p>

<p>
I knew not what to say, for this woman's magnificent
eyes were searchingly fixed on mine, and they bewildered,
or fascinated me nearly as much as those of the serpent had
done her.
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur was about to observe&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"That I am only too happy in having been here in time
to do madame a service."
</p>

<p>
"You call preserving my life a service&mdash;a mere service!"
</p>

<p>
"And now, madame, I must leave you."
</p>

<p>
"Leave me already?  Oh no, no&mdash;this must not be; you
cannot think of this, when I have scarcely known you, and
owe you&mdash;oh, how much?"
</p>

<p>
"Madame must excuse me.  I have wandered far from
my quarters&mdash;farther than the orders of the general
permit&mdash;and I must return to the garrison at Needham's Point,
before the darkness sets in, for being a stranger in Barbadoes,
I shall infallibly lose my way."
</p>

<p>
"My house is at hand, and ere you go, some wine&mdash;some
refreshment shall be given you.  Monsieur cannot
refuse me&mdash;a lady&mdash;come."
</p>

<p>
She placed her arm through mine, and gazed so winningly
in my face, that I could not refuse; moreover, for months
I had not seen any other of the fair sex than "Mother
Mahoney," nor since the period of my enlistment had been
addressed as an equal by a lady; thus, the charm of this
Frenchwoman's manner fascinated not less than her beauty
dazzled me, the more perhaps that I was her junior by
four or five years.
</p>

<p>
Shuddering as she passed the hewn fragments of her late
source of terror, she led me along the cabbage-walk, as the
avenue of magnificent trees (the smallest being forty feet in
height) was named, and we soon found ourselves close to a
small villa or cottage, surrounded by a broad verandah which
was completely covered by luxuriant flowers.  The garden
was enclosed by lime-trees, which grow there like the holly-bush,
full of leaves and fruit, and were wont to be used by
the planters of old as a protecting hedge against runaway
slaves and wild Carribs.  Dusk now set in rapidly, for
there is no twilight in these regions, and the cave-bat&mdash;the
bird of darkness&mdash;which here is as large as a pigeon, was
flitting among the great palm branches of the cabbage-trees,
and the fireflies shot to and fro, like red sparks or tiny
meteors.
</p>

<p>
The villa was entered through a trellised porch of very
ornamental form.  It was constructed of the wild cane split,
intertwisted and arched in a Gothic style, but covered by the
dark and sharp-pointed leaves of the passion-flower or
lemon-water-vine, named by some, "love in a mist."  Like
other West-Indian houses, it was not tiled, but shingled, and
was without chimneys.  The walls were painted pure white.
</p>

<p>
Black female servants clad in striped cotton stuffs, with
strings of beads and palm-oil nuts about their necks, received
us with deep respect, and ushered us into a low-ceiled room
paved with square tiles, and having four glazed windows,
which opened to the floor.  These were unclosed, and the
warm night-air&mdash;for the tropical night had now set in&mdash;was
admitted through green Venetian blinds.
</p>

<p>
Lamps were lighted, and then I could perceive that the
apartment was neatly&mdash;almost handsomely&mdash;furnished in the
style of a Barbadian drawing-room of those days; a piano,
music, flowers, pictures, books, and a few articles of <i>bijouterie</i>
were there, with those pretty trifles which we usually find
in such an apartment in all countries.
</p>

<p>
"Pray be seated, monsieur," said the young lady, "and
be assured you are most welcome to my abode."
</p>

<p>
I bowed, and at that moment a clock struck nine.  I
thought of the roll call, from which I would be absent; but
the Frenchwoman's eyes seem to read the alarming thought,
and laying her pretty hand upon my arm, she said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Hark&mdash;do you hear that?"
</p>

<p>
"It is artillery!" said I, starting.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, monsieur&mdash;the artillery of heaven.  'Tis thunder.
The beauty of the past day, and the closeness of the
evening, foretold we should have a storm; so be assured you
are safer here, than on the road to Needham's Point to-night."
</p>

<p>
Even while she spoke, we could hear the roar of the
thunder hurtling in the distance, while red lines of horizontal
light were seen for an instant, as the fierce electric fires of
the Antilles flashed through the green spars of the Venetian
blinds.

CHAPTER XXX.
<br><br>
THE FORBIDDEN FRUIT.
</h3>

<p>
A sense of the risk I encountered by absence from my
quarters, in a strange country, and while having with me
the order-book of my company, a volume which contained so
many details relating to our embarkation for Martinique
and our mode of landing there, recurred to me so vividly,
that after hastily taking a glass or two of wine, on a lull
in the booming of the thunder, I arose, and lifting the
Venetian blinds gazed upon the night, which was
dark&mdash;fearfully so, even for the tropics.
</p>

<p>
"Madame," said I, with hesitation, lest I might appear
ungracious to one so charming in person, and so winning in
manner, "I beseech you to excuse me; but&mdash;but you
spoke a moment since, of the gratitude you owed me for
the trifling service&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Mon Dieu! he calls my life a trifle&mdash;and saving it, a
trivial service!" she exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"Pardon me, but if missed from the garrison, you know
not the penalty I incur, in times of war," I urged with
great earnestness.
</p>

<p>
"Nay but I do, for I know more of soldiering than I ever
care to see again."
</p>

<p>
"Then, madame, if one of your servants, or a trusty
negro, would be my guide to Needham's Point&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She patted my cheek with her large fan, and bending
her bright dark eyes into mine, with a glance at once merry
and tender, said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Compose yourself; a storm is coming on, and you
cannot go."
</p>

<p>
"I must, lady," I continued, impelled by the force and
habit of discipline; "without leave, what else can I do?"
</p>

<p>
"Foolish boy; you would lose your way and be destroyed.
There are steep rocks, covered by creeping plants, so thick
and luxuriant, that they would take you up to the neck,
and these jungles are full of snakes and fortylegs as
large as one's hand, and their bite is dreadful.  I think
we have had enough of reptiles to-night!  Then there
are deep gullies rent by earthquakes, full of slime, dwarf
mangroves, wild cucumbers, and other weeds, as tall as a
man; and there lurk in the thickets runaway negroes and
others who are worse; but all bad enough for a solitary
stranger to encounter; and then there will be the rain and
the wind and the lightning; and for all these you would
leave my pleasant little drawing-room, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And your society, you would say reproachfully."
</p>

<p>
"Precisely so.  Ah, you know not a midnight storm in
the Antilles."
</p>

<p>
"The night certainly is very dark," said I, beginning to
yield to her arguments and beauty.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; as a French writer says, 'it is one of those nights
which are too dark for murder&mdash;too dark even for love!'"
</p>

<p>
"Is it ungallant to say, I am thinking of neither?" said
I, laughing, while my cheek flushed as this singular woman
placed her white hand gently on mine, as if more fully to
persuade me; "but why that thought?"
</p>

<p>
"'Tis very natural: darkness makes one think of love,
does it not?"
</p>

<p>
"To me, it would rather be suggestive of danger.  For
love, I would rather have moonlight."
</p>

<p>
"But not in the tropics where the moon is like a second
sun.  But you must not leave me, monsieur, on such a night,
and in this place which is so solitary.  I have not been used
to dwell alone."
</p>

<p>
"No one lives here with you?"
</p>

<p>
"None," said she, shaking her head almost sorrowfully,
adding, "I am older than you by some years; thus I
command you to stay."
</p>

<p>
My head swam, and my heart seemed to take fire.  I
felt the pressure of her little hand tightening upon mine.
</p>

<p>
"I must go," I faltered&mdash;yet stayed.
</p>

<p>
At that moment there was a terrific glare of lightning,
and a peal of thunder overhead.  I let fall the Venetian
blind.  We staggered, dazzled by the gleam, and, somehow
my arm went round her.  She did not altogether resist, for
she was terrified, and I led her to a seat in our confusion.
</p>

<p>
On the sofa we sat in silence for some time, listening to
the howl of the rising wind, which was tossing the vast palm
branches of the cabbage-trees, causing them to shriek and
groan; while some active negroes,&mdash;strong herculean fellows,
in red osnaburg jackets and drawers,&mdash;were hurriedly
closing the outer shutters of the house, but leaving the
sash-window open; for the heat, even at that season of the year,
was somewhat oppressive.  Heavy, globular drops of rain,
now plashed in fierce and rapid succession, till they descended
like a sheet of water on the orange and lemon groves, and
with a roaring sound on the broad fields of sugar-cane around
the villa; and when I looked forth again, through a species
of wicket or sliding panel in one of the shutters, the aspect
of the night filled me with an emotion of awe.
</p>

<p>
"You see, monsieur, it <i>can</i> rain, when it pleases, here in
the West Indies," said the lady playfully; "and in
proportion as the rain falls, the wind rises."
</p>

<p>
The tempest seemed to come from every point of the
compass at once.  Enormous trees were swaying in every
direction.  Green forky lightning shot through the sky's
gloomy vault tearing asunder the black masses of
surcharged cloud, which the wind was also rending, sweeping,
and twisting, with frightful rapidity, into an endless variety
of forms; the ghastly glare revealing momentarily, and
with wondrous distinctness, the tossing trees, the green
leaves, broad branches, and gnarled trunks of the avenue,
close by; and the fields of sugar-cane, afar off, waving
forward and backward, like the billows of an inland sea.
All this would be visible for an instant; and then, as the
gleam passed away, was shrouded and lost in blinding rain
and utter darkness.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Monsieur le Soldat, said I not true?" whispered
the lady, as she shut the panel and we returned to the sofa;
"where would you have been by this time, and what your
fate, had I wickedly permitted you to leave me, and on such
a night as this?"
</p>

<p>
"The debt of gratitude is now transferred from you to
me," said I, smiling; "and now I am your willing captive."
</p>

<p>
"Then let us to supper; we shall talk after."
</p>

<p>
The supper consisted of cold fowls, ham, and tongue,
served up with anchovies, caviare, and several kinds of
sauces.  There were fruits, sweetmeats, limes preserved in
sugar, and wines of various kinds, but chiefly malmsey and
vidonia&mdash;the former flavoured like canary, and the latter
brisk and dry like sherry, but coloured with tent.  While
pressing all these good things upon me, I observed that my
fair hostess drank only a little cooled citron water&mdash;a
famous cordial in the Antilles; but the entire novelty of my
situation and perplexity as to who this lady was&mdash;whether
maid, wife, or widow&mdash;deprived me of all appetite; while
the charming frankness the gaiety, and unconcealed
coquetry of her manner, made me, at the few years I had then
attained, peculiarly liable to any snare she might set for me.
These ideas ran swiftly through my mind while seated by
her side; and in truth, such is the force of evil example,
and such were the recklessness and easy disposition of those
among whom my lot had latterly been cast by sea and land,
that I can scarcely be surprised at the flexibility or laxity
of principle, which rendered me tolerably careless as to
<i>how</i> my new and beautiful friend was related in life.  My
chief curiosity was to learn her name&mdash;my desire to please
her.
</p>

<p>
"May I ask how far I am from the garrison?"
</p>

<p>
"The garrison&mdash;always that tiresome garrison!" said she,
selecting some grapes from a basket; "you are, I know not
how far; but what does it matter, child, especially in such a
storm as this?"
</p>

<p>
"And this place&mdash;how is it named?"
</p>

<p>
"Boscobelle."
</p>

<p>
"The beautiful wood?"
</p>

<p>
"Oui, monsieur, and a charming place you will find it,
though that odious serpent was your introducteur."
</p>

<p>
"And&mdash;pardon me&mdash;<i>your</i> name, madame?"
</p>

<p>
She changed colour and paused.
</p>

<p>
"What matters my name?" she asked, with a lovely
smile; "are you tired of me?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, why that question, madame?" I asked, taking her
hand tenderly in mine.
</p>

<p>
"Because it would seem as if one was weary when one
asks questions."
</p>

<p>
"Pray tell me?" I urged, in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
"Well, when I was baptized by the old curé of
St. Germain de Prez, at Paris, my godmother named me
Eulalie&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And you are now&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Now," she reiterated.
</p>

<p>
"Still Eulalie only?"
</p>

<p>
"Have I not told you enough?" she asked, smiling.
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Mon Dieu</i>, how inquisitive it is!  Is not Eulalie all you
need when addressing me? and you&mdash;I must have revenge&mdash;how
are you named."
</p>

<p>
"Oliver&mdash;Oliver Ellis."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Très bon</i>&mdash;Oliver&mdash;good; I shall treasure that in my
heart of hearts!"
</p>

<p>
"And <i>your</i> surname?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you pertinacious and provoking one!  Know then,
that, to my misfortune, I am named Eulalie de Rouvigny."
</p>

<p>
"Surely I have heard this name before?" said I, starting,
and endeavouring to remember.
</p>

<p>
"Very probably; it is the name of a well-known French
officer, who commands in Martinique."
</p>

<p>
"The Colonel de Rouvigny, chef de bataillon of a revolted
regiment?"
</p>

<p>
"The same."
</p>

<p>
"True&mdash;I now remember&mdash;a pretty name," said I, taking
her hand again and kissing it; "and yours is Eulalie&mdash;that
is charming!  Is the colonel any relation?  I should hope
not, as we may be fighting with him in the course of next
week."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, no," she replied with a shudder, "no relation."
</p>

<p>
"You know him then?"
</p>

<p>
A smile, singularly sardonic on such a beautiful little face,
was perceptible as she answered briefly,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"How?"
</p>

<p>
"He is only my husband."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Husband!</i>" I reiterated, as my romance vanished like a
soap-bubble.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Mon Dieu!</i> does that surprise you so much, that you
must drop my poor little hand as if it were a hot poker, or
Surinam beetle?"
</p>

<p>
"You will pardon me."
</p>

<p>
"People, to their misfortune, have husbands sometimes,
monsieur," said she with a demure pout.
</p>

<p>
"And you are here&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"An emigrant, or prisoner of war&mdash;which you will."
</p>

<p>
"Separated from him&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"For nearly a year."
</p>

<p>
"How sad!"
</p>

<p>
"I do not find it very sad; nor would you think so,
Monsieur Oliver, if you knew all," said she with an air of
annoyance.
</p>

<p>
"How came this about; for you seem a very willing
prisoner of war?"
</p>

<p>
"I was returning to France in a ship from St. Pierre, but
was captured by one of your cruisers, and landed here.
M. le Gouverneur of the Barbadoes assigned to me this pretty
villa of Boscobelle, to which you, my preserver, are most
welcome!  What more would you wish to learn?"
</p>

<p>
I was silent; for I had heard that the wife of a French
commander in the Windward Isles was the prisoner of war
who had supplied us with many details, as to the number of
men, guns, and fortresses in Martinique and Guadaloupe&mdash;details
which Sir Charles Grey found of the greatest value,
when maturing those plans of conquest for which the
great armament wherein I formed a unit, was fitted out by
Britain.
</p>

<p>
The rank, name, and solitary condition of my beautiful
young hostess, though they would have encouraged an older
or more reckless gallant, all conduced to silence and
bewilder me.  She quickly perceived this; but was too
polite, or too politic to remark it, and pressed me to take
more wine.  I did so; but after a time my perplexity and
constraint seemed to annoy her, and she asked,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Of what are you thinking, monsieur?"
</p>

<p>
"What the world might say of all this."
</p>

<p>
"All what&mdash;I do not comprehend, monsieur," said she,
while her cheek reddened, and her bosom heaved.  "What
has the odious world to do with our little supper?  But talk
not to me of the world," she added bitterly, while her fine
eyes flashed with sudden fire; "'tis not the world I
dreamed it to be when I viewed it only through the iron
grilles, and gay flower garden of the old convent in which
I was reared at Paris.  I have lived to see its folly, its
hollowness, its bitterness and falsehood.  I am without
friends, country, prospects&mdash;hope!  Love may lighten&mdash;but
death alone could release me from it.  Do you understand
this?" she asked almost fiercely.
</p>

<p>
"No, madame."
</p>

<p>
"What a child it is!" she exclaimed, pouting again, and
then added in a subdued voice; "you have not yet seen
your nearest and dearest perish in the shambles of the Place
de la Grève, or amid the horrors of the Vendean war&mdash;or
the greater atrocities of these Indian isles, but let me not
think of such things.  Fill me a glass of vidonia&mdash;thank
you.  Some time I shall tell you my story; meantime,
allow me to assist you to more wine; there is a song
which says&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Valour the stronger grows,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stronger liquor we are drinking;<br>
  And how can we feel our woes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we've lost the trouble of thinking?<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
She sang this with charming naïveté and added, "Monsieur
will perceive that I have not lived in barracks without
learning something.  Do allow me to assist you to more
fruit."
</p>

<p>
"These are wonderful oranges."
</p>

<p>
"They are <i>not</i> oranges," said she, while her naturally
coquettish smile returned to her dark eye, and ruddy lip;
"do you not perceive that they are longer and larger than
the largest orange, and have the flavor of the shaddock?"
</p>

<p>
"True."
</p>

<p>
"I gathered them from a tree in the garden."
</p>

<p>
"With those charming little hands."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! monsieur is recovering from his surprise I perceive."
</p>

<p>
"And they are named&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"The forbidden fruit," said she, laughing merrily; "so I
have tempted you as our common ancestor was tempted.
'Tis like a drama at the Porte St. Martin, a serpent in
the first act&mdash;the fruit in the second&mdash;thunder and
lightning throughout;" and sinking back on the down sofa, she
burst into a merry fit of laughter.  As she did so, I
perceived that she had beautiful teeth; but in all the charms
of her person, she was perfect.  Again I took her hands in
mine.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, madame, your story&mdash;I am full of curiosity: What
time so fitting as the present, when we are quite alone and
undisturbed?  All is silent, too; for even the storm has
lulled, and is passing away.  Yet&mdash;yet, I still hear
something."
</p>

<p>
"What is it?"
</p>

<p>
"The beating of my heart."
</p>

<p>
"Hush.  We must not speak thus.  Well, <i>attendez, mon
soldat</i>, and you shall learn how I came to be seated by your
side to-night in this lonely villa, in the island of
Barbadoes."
</p>

<p>
Still permitting me to retain her hands in mine&mdash;for she
was full of little coquetries&mdash;she cast down her fine eyelids,
and after a few moments' reflection, began, as nearly as I
can remember, in the following words, a narrative sufficiently
full of incident to have made a three-volume novel.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap31"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXI.
<br><br>
THE STORY OF EULALIE.
</h3>

<p>
My father, Marie-Dominique Louis de Mazancy, Sieur de
St. Valliere, was a gentleman of Lower Dauphiny, and the
lineal descendant of that unfortunate M. de Mazancy, whom
M. le Terrail slew in presence of Henry IV., before the
windows of the gallery of the Louvre, and whose death so
deeply affected that monarch, who, as history records, loved
and respected him beyond all his courtiers.  My father was
chef de bataillon of the Régiment de Dauphiné, of the
French line, and having served in all the wars of the late
king's reign, was a chevalier of St. Louis and all the royal
orders.  He was the bosom friend and brother soldier of
the brave Comte de Lusignan, colonel of the Régiment de
Flandre (which was entirely composed of persons of the
second order of nobility), whose venerable head became the
foot-ball of a Parisian mob.
</p>

<p>
I was named Marie Domenica, after my father, and
Eulalie, after my poor mother, Mademoiselle de Losme,
sister of the unfortunate major of the terrible Bastille.  M. le
Major de Losme was a brave and worthy officer, who, by his
extreme gentleness and compassion, had done much to
alleviate the sorrows of the unhappy prisoners who pined in
the towers and dungeons of that dreaded fortress; yet this
availed him nothing, when it fell before the cannon and
beneath the execrations of the people.  He perished with
the Governor, M. de Launay, in the hands of a frenzied
multitude in the Place de la Grève.
</p>

<p>
I was educated at a little distance from Paris in an
Ursuline convent, situated among the vine-covered hills of
Mont l'Hery; and while there enjoyed the friendship of
Mademoiselle de Karalio, one of the most celebrated ladies
in France, authoress of a history of Elizabeth of England,
and many other works&mdash;a lady whose pen vigorously
defended the demolition of the Bastille, and exculpated the
miserable M. Danry, who was incarcerated there for life for
having offended&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
I interrupted her,
</p>

<p>
"The king, of course?"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"No; for something then esteemed much more serious;
his royal father's mistress."
</p>

<p>
"Madame de Pompadour?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"And a life was required to expiate this!"
</p>

<p>
Madame resumed her narrative.
</p>

<p>
You see how much my country required a revolution of
some kind.  At the end of fourteen years M. Danry wrote
two penitent letters, one to the Minister of France; the
other to Madame de Pompadour, full of tears, of penitence,
and prayers for mercy; describing his hair, which from
being a rich brown, had now become thin and grey; his
wasted form and exceeding misery, adding that he had almost
lost all his faculties by the very monotony of his captivity;
but these sorrowful productions&mdash;the keen outpourings of
a broken spirit and a broken heart&mdash;were never delivered.
</p>

<p>
Years rolled on.
</p>

<p>
Louis XV. and his Pompadour were gathered to their
fathers; Louis XVI. succeeded, and thereafter, poor
M. Danry died in his dark dungeon; and when the Bastille was
demolished, his two sorrowful letters were found in the
Governor's house with their seals <i>unbroken</i>.  Mademoiselle
Karalio showed them to me, with cold irony in her intelligent
eyes, when I was weeping for the terrible death of my
uncle, the Major de Losme.
</p>

<p>
The terrors of the Revolution, as detailed to me by
Mademoiselle, and the horror I felt on hearing that my gentle
mother had been guillotined for no other crime than being
an aristocrat and the sister of De Losme, filled me with such
a disgust for life, that I conceived the idea of taking the
veil in some convent remote from Paris (the vicinity of
which was far from safe), and of retiring for ever from a
world of which I knew but little, and in which I had so few
ties; for my father was then serving abroad, having command
of the French troops in the islands of Martinique and
Guadaloupe.
</p>

<p>
These resolutions were warmly seconded by him, as he had
once made a vow, after a narrow escape in battle, if he ever
had a child, to dedicate it to the Church; and by the
Ursulines with whom I had lived for seven years, and among
whom I made many dear and amiable friends, his views
were earnestly urged.  I redoubled all the austerities we
had hitherto practised, and, inspired by a religious fervour,
on which I now look back with astonishment&mdash;for I was
barely twenty&mdash;spent nearly my whole time in the chapel of
of our establishment and on my knees.
</p>

<p>
I had commenced my five years' noviciate, and measures
were in progress for my removal, together with all the
younger ladies of our house, to a more remote convent of
the order, when one day a card was brought to me by a lay
sister.  It was inscribed&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Le Chevalier de Losme."
</p>

<p>
I started on receiving it, and remembered that this
gentlemen, my cousin Adrien, had long been absent with the
army in India, and under the circumstances of his recent
bereavement, I could not decline to receive him.  I could
neither repress the blush that rose to my cheek, or certain
emotions of awkwardness and curiosity, when I remembered
that it had once been a favourite project of my mother and
her brother the major of the Bastille, to marry me to this
identical cousin, and that he was cognizant of their wish.
</p>

<p>
I adjusted my hood and veil, adopted my most severe and
demure expression of face, and in presence of Madame the
Superior, awaited, with something of an inward flutter, the
entrance of my cousin.
</p>

<p>
He reminded me in feature almost painfully of my dead
mother.  He was young and handsome, and still wore, in
defiance of the Revolutionists, the white and gold-laced
uniform of the Régiment de Bearn.  His face expressed
gravity, and his eyes had a sadness in them that made him
very interesting, especially to an enthusiastic and
imaginative young girl.  When his quiet eyes met mine, their
glance, I knew not why, troubled me, and my cheek flushed
so redly, that our Superior afterwards remarked my emotion.
When he spoke to me kindly and tenderly as my kinsman, I
became uneasy, unhappy, and disturbed.
</p>

<p>
"Why was this?  You smile; ah, already you begin to
perceive that Mademoiselle Eulalie was not fated to fulfil
her father's wish.
</p>

<p>
"My dear cousin, I have just returned from Pondicherry,"
said he kissing my hand in defiance of the frowns of Madame
the Reverend Mother, "and reached this now hateful city
of Paris only in time to find the common scaffold wet with
the blood of all that was noble in France&mdash;all that were
nearest and dearest to you and to me; and now I go to
Flanders, to seek vengeance under the banner of M. le
Comte d'Artois, who has collected an army of emigrants, and
has honoured me with a commission in the regiment of
Noble Infantry."
</p>

<p>
"Shall&mdash;shall I not see you again?" I asked timidly, for
in spite of me, my heart was warming and yearning towards
this handsome young man, my only kinsman in France
and, save my father, in the world.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, if you wish it, my dear Eulalie."
</p>

<p>
"He calls me 'dear Eulalie,'" said I, in my heart.  It
seemed so oddly, so new to be thus addressed by a man; and
my own name never sounded so sweet or so musical before.
</p>

<p>
"And you have resolved on this secluded life, cousin?"
said he, playing with his aiguilettes.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; it is my choice," said I, sighing.
</p>

<p>
"It is terrible, Eulalie," he urged impressively.
</p>

<p>
"And is my father's wish," I added, sighing again.
</p>

<p>
"But it was not the wish of madame your mother.  Do
you remember how often she jested with me about my
little wife&mdash;you cannot have forgotten those happy childish
days."
</p>

<p>
I was blushing painfully, for the Superior's impatience,
as the conversation became more and more perilous, was
marked and oppressive, though my soldierly cousin heeded
the old lady not in the least.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Eulalie," he continued, "I trust you have weighed
the matter well.  Life is a precious gift, and not to be
trifled with."
</p>

<p>
I became painfully agitated; but, as my mother's name
filled my eyes with tears, Cousin Adrien changed the
subject.
</p>

<p>
"And you leave Paris?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Very soon, unless you would wish me to remain a little
time, to see you again; but I am already, I fear, a
suspected man.  The son of the Chevalier Major de Losme, is
nowhere safe in France," he added bitterly; "and so the
veil is your choice, my beautiful cousin.  I dare not
congratulate you; but I pray in my inmost heart, that you
may be happy, dear Eulalie!"
</p>

<p>
He bowed and retired, but his voice seemed to linger in
my ear.  The brow of our reverend mother was clouded,
and I hurried to my little cell full of new and strange
thoughts.  I cast myself upon my bed and wept, I knew
not why.  I strove to thrust aside the image of my cousin&mdash;to
turn my mind to prayer and the duties of my office;
but in vain; the handsome form and figure of the dark
and sad-eyed young man, in his white uniform and gold
aiguilettes still hovered before me, and I began to wonder
when he would visit me again.
</p>

<p>
"This is quite natural; there is nothing wrong in the
interest I feel in Adrien," said I; "he is my kinsman, the
nephew of my dear mother, who is now in heaven."
</p>

<p>
"It matters not, Eulalie," said the superior, who followed
me one day and overheard my remark; "you must think
no more of him; bend your thoughts in prayer, and say a
<i>Salve Regina</i> daily; each morning and evening intreat the
protection of St. Ursule, and shun alike the society and the
sophistries of that vile woman Karalio, whose writings have
corrupted Paris and are tainting you."
</p>

<p>
I endeavoured to do all this; but my cousin's next
visit overturned every little plan, and I now began to
perceive that I had viewed seclusion on one hand, and the
external world on the other, through false mediums.  I was
no longer content and tranquil; I still prayed with ardour,
but prayer soon became a task,&mdash;my thoughts rebelled
against myself, and strayed ever from the duties set before me.
</p>

<p>
At last a crisis came!  One night we were roused from
sleep by the sound of drums and alarm-bells; by the glare of
torches and the gleam of weapons, as a revolutionary mob,
which had sacked and demolished a chateau in our vicinity,
flushed with bloodshed, wine, and outrage, assailed the
convent.  Its doors were driven in; the chapel was pillaged
of its altar-vessels, vestments, and reliquary; the nuns were
driven forth with every indignity, and two who attempted
to rebuke the multitude were stripped nearly nude and
bayoneted.  I fled I know not whither; so great was my
terror, that I must have been almost bereft of reason, as I
can only remember being found in a peasant's hut by my
cousin, the Chevalier de Losme, some weeks after the
destruction of the convent of St. Ursule; for the moment
he heard of that catastrophe, he had hastened from Paris to
Mont l'Hery to save and protect me.
</p>

<p>
My ecclesiastical habit being no longer a safeguard in
France, I laid it aside for ever.  My cousin procured for me
a residence in a secluded village, and promised to get me
released from the remainder of the five years' vows I had
taken; and with mutual promises of love and fidelity we
separated in tears and sorrow, as he repaired to join the
army of the Comte d'Artois.
</p>

<p>
He wrote to Martinique, and duly informed my father of
all that had passed,&mdash;of what were our own views and wishes,
and how dearly he loved me; but the Sieur de Mazancy
was indignant on learning that I wished to return to the
world, and wrote to the chevalier and to me, reprehending
in severe terms my desire to obtain a double dispensation,
which was necessary, as we were related within the degrees
forbidden by the church.  This communication filled me
with agony, sorrow, and alarm; but my spirit soon rose, for
the free-and-easy precepts of the time, as instilled into me
by Mademoiselle Karalio, made me revolt against so severe
an exertion of parental authority.
</p>

<p>
My father's letter was delivered to me by a subaltern&mdash;a
sous-lieutenant of his regiment&mdash;named Thibaud de
Rouvigny, a native of Dauphiny, where his father was
steward of our estates.  He was a man of a dreadful nature,
for though, externally suave, smiling, polite, and winning, at
heart he was a villain of the deepest dye; and the distance
at which he found me from aid, my helplessness and personal
attractions, made him conceive the most daring designs
against me, with the most dazzling hope of success; yet he
was too wary to speak to me then of love, and his whole
conversation consisted of pious morality&mdash;of resignation to
the wish of my father and to the will of God.  I deemed
him a model of goodness and propriety, and opened up all
my heart to him.  There were times when I thought a
sinister gloom shot across his face; but this might be the
result of a deep sword-cut, by which his forehead had been
laid open.
</p>

<p>
My cousin Adrien had now been absent from me some
months; but his heart was inspired by undiminished love;
and through M. le Comte d'Artois, who was sincerely
attached to him, he hoped ultimately to overcome alike the
scruples of my father and those of the exiled Archbishop of
Paris, who maintained that I ought to complete in some
Ursuline Convent the five years of the white veil.
</p>

<p>
Rouvigny affected to sympathize with me, and by his artful
advice I wrote two letters, one to my father, in which I
stated that I renounced the Chevalier de Losme for ever, as I
had ceased to love him.  To Adrien, I wrote assuring him that
the threats, the animosity or repugnance of my father to
our union would never influence me in the slightest degree,
or lessen the tender love I bore for him, and him only;
and these two most important letters I sealed up and
committed to the care of the Sous-Lieutenant Rouvigny.
</p>

<p>
What think you he did in secret?
</p>

<p>
He opened the covers and <i>transposed</i> the contents;
sending to my father the letter in which I breathed
the purity of my passion for De Losme, and to De Losme
the letter for my father in which I renounced him for
ever!
</p>

<p>
After the performance of this perfidy, Rouvigny left me,
and I saw him no more, in France at least, for he was
ordered back to Martinique, with a detachment for my
father's garrison.
</p>

<p>
My dear cousin was filled with grief on receiving a
document so unexpected.  He knew my writing and signature
too well to imagine there was any deception.  He wrote
me a sorrowful adieu, and next morning volunteered for a
forlorn hope at the storming of a redoubt near Louvain.
He was taken prisoner, and offered life and liberty by
Dumourier, if he would only say "Vive la Nation&mdash;à bas le
Roi."  He refused, and was shot dead by a platoon.
</p>

<p>
One of the balls which pierced his heart had also pierced
a letter that was worn next it.
</p>

<p>
That letter was mine&mdash;the fatal letter transmitted to him
by the perfidious Rouvigny, of whose treason I was yet
ignorant.
</p>

<p>
Such was the fate of the faithful and brave De Losme!

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXII.
<br><br>
STORY OF EULALIE CONTINUED.
</h3>

<p>
I was still mourning for Adrien, when my father wrote
me to join him by the first ship for Martinique, as France
had now become a land of horror, where daily&mdash;yea,
hourly&mdash;massacres took place in every city and hamlet, and
where, under the general title of aristocrats, priests, nuns,
and noblesse were butchered, banished, or maltreated, with
a barbarity worthy of the industrious cruelty of Caffres or
Carib Indians.
</p>

<p>
In a month after this, I sailed from Havre in the corvette
<i>Egalité</i>, and without emotion saw the two light-houses on
the steep white brow of Cape la Hêve sink like stars into
the blue evening sea, for I was more dead to the world
than when in the convent of St. Ursule, and (save for my
father's sake) careless whether or not I ever saw the isle of
Martinique.
</p>

<p>
I shall not detain you with the monotony of the voyage,
though its even tenor was broken by two startling
incidents&mdash;our flight from a British frigate, which followed us
pertinaciously for ten days, and shot away some of our spars
and sails, and might have taken us, but for a dark and
stormy night, in which we lost sight of each other; the
second incident had more direct reference to myself, for on
that night I had a narrow escape from a monster of the
deep.
</p>

<p>
I was awakened by water pouring into the little berth in
which I slept; when, lo! it was discovered that a swordfish
had driven its nasal weapon into the ship, through a
double sheathing of iron, a planking three inches thick and
deep, into one of the frigate's timbers, where it was found
torn from the animal's body.
</p>

<p>
A fortnight after this, I reached Martinique, to find that
the horrors I had left behind me in France had commenced
there with equal, or, if possible, with greater fury.  The
inhabitants&mdash;white, black, and coloured&mdash;were in revolt;
the garrisons were in mutiny, and all was havock, bloodshed
and disorder.
</p>

<p>
Terrified and bewildered by the scenes that met me, I
reached the citadel of St. Pierre, over which the tricolor
had replaced the white banner of the Bourbons.  I was
compelled to proceed there on foot, under a burning sun; for
when I inquired at the hotel for a carriage, I was insulted
as an "aristocrat."  On reaching the gate of the fortress,
I found the guard in a state of disorder and intoxication,
seated under a verandah, smoking Havannah cigars, and
drinking sangaree.  I requested one to lead me to their
commander.
</p>

<p>
"What commander do you mean?" stammered one.
</p>

<p>
"The commandant," said I indignantly; "M. de Mazancy,
Chevalier of St. Louis, and Sieur de St. Valliere."
</p>

<p>
"Who the devil are you talking about, citoyenne?" asked
a tipsy corporal with an oath; "we know of no such man,
as the assembly has abolished all such trumpery and orders
of nobility."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ma belle</i>" said another, "you mean old Citizen Mazancy,
whom we have sent to the <i>gamelle</i>&mdash;where, par Dieu, he
has before sent me and many a better man."
</p>

<p>
"A bas les aristocrats&mdash;vive la nation&mdash;vive la Ligne!"
cried one or two others reeling round me.
</p>

<p>
Paris seemed to have followed me over the sea, for the
wretches now seized me with great rudeness.
</p>

<p>
"Ouf, my little coquette," said one, tearing off my
head-dress, "is this the latest fashion from Paris?"
</p>

<p>
I burst into tears, as I knew not what was in futurity for
my father or myself, if such were the state of his garrison,
in which he had maintained a discipline worthy of the
proverbial Colonel de Martinet of the Régiment du Roi;
and, indeed, that officer had always been my father's favorite
model.  The tipsy corporal was about to insist on kissing
me, when he was roughly thrust aside by a tall dark officer,
in whom, by his fierce eyes, enormous moustache, and
cicatriced forehead, I recognized Thibaud, the son of our old
steward at St. Valliere.
</p>

<p>
"Rouvigny," I exclaimed; "help me, M. de Rouvigny,"
while the soldiers uttered a half-tipsy shout of mockery and
anger at the intrusion of an epaulette.
</p>

<p>
"Eulalie&mdash;Mademoiselle Eulalie here&mdash;here in
Martinique! what marvel is this?" he asked; "I am so
enchanted to see you, that I am without words&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Excuse me, M. le Lieutenant," said I coldly, for I had
now certain undefined suspicions regarding him; "but be
assured that the enchantment is exclusively your own."
</p>

<p>
"Mademoiselle," said he, attempting to kiss my hand, "I
am honoured."
</p>

<p>
"That is as may be," I replied sharply: "but lead me to
my father."
</p>

<p>
"Her <i>father</i>!" exclaimed the soldiers, in varying tones
of surprise and regret; "<i>Sang Dieu!</i> 'tis the daughter of
old Citizen Mazancy."
</p>

<p>
"Excuse me," said the lieutenant, with a troubled expression;
"but at present this introduction is impossible."
</p>

<p>
"Impossible!" I reiterated, proudly and indignantly;
"<i>Mon Dieu!</i> what do you mean, sir?  Does he not
command the troops in this island?"
</p>

<p>
"He <i>did</i> 'command them.'"
</p>

<p>
"Did?"
</p>

<p>
"Oui, mademoiselle."
</p>

<p>
"Has he, too, been superseded by the National Assembly."
</p>

<p>
"No, mademoiselle&mdash;citoyenne, I mean."
</p>

<p>
"By whom, then?"
</p>

<p>
"By the people, citoyenne&mdash;the nation as represented by
the free citizens of Martinique, who now decline to recognize
an officer who was sent here by Louis XVI., and is resolutely
bent on upholding the name and authority of the boy
in the Temple, whom he names Louis XVII."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, what is this you tell me, sir!" I exclaimed, clasping
my hands; "my father&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Is a state prisoner."
</p>

<p>
"Where, monsieur&mdash;where?  Lead me to him&mdash;to my
father&mdash;my dear father, whom I have come so far to see, and
to make the depository of my sorrows," I implored, in a
passion of grief, as his thin and reverend figure seemed to
rise before me; "M. Rouvigny, lead me to him."
</p>

<p>
"Mademoiselle, I tell you it is impossible; but you shall
see him to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"When?"
</p>

<p>
"At noon."
</p>

<p>
"Where?"
</p>

<p>
"In this barrack-yard," he replied gloomily.
</p>

<p>
"How, monsieur,&mdash;how?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Tonnerre de Ciel!</i>" said the ruffian, casting off all
disguise, "with a handkerchief at his eyes, and a platoon of
twelve muskets levelled at his breast.  You have reached
Martinique in good time to see how we handle those who
have so long trodden the people under foot."
</p>

<p>
I wrung my hands, and would have sunk on hearing those
terrible tidings so coldly, so savagely announced, had not
Rouvigny grasped my arm.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my father!" I gasped; "and I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Must meantime, as an aristocrat, become my prisoner,"
said he, while his cruel and sinister eyes sparkled with an
expression which there was no mistaking, and by which I
could not fail to be struck by greater horror and dismay.
</p>

<p>
"Your prisoner!" I exclaimed, while the light seemed
to pass from my eyes, the life from my crushed heart, and
the strength from my limbs, as I became insensible, and
remember no more until the following day.
</p>

<p>
By the rays of the sun that played upon the wall, I
suspected that noon,&mdash;the time at which I was to see my
father&mdash;must already have arrived.  I started on discovering
that I was a prisoner in one of the vaulted chambers of the
citadel of St. Pierre.
</p>

<p>
My present situation, the last words of Rouvigny, and
the danger that menaced my helpless father, all rushed,
with returning life, upon me, and I sank back on the
truckle-bed, to which, no doubt, the soldiers had, overnight,
conveyed me.  My wretched apartment was a mere stone
vault.  Near me, a pitcher of water was placed upon a stool.
I drank thirstily, and on rising looked about me.
</p>

<p>
My prison had two windows or horizontal slits, grated
with iron; and through these the sun's rays struggled
feebly in.  From one I could perceive the two slender spires
of the town, and the road beyond it, winding over a green
hill to Fort Royal, with the bright glassy bay of St. Pierre
full of shipping.  From the other, I could perceive the
courtyard of the citadel, where, already, the soldiers of the
garrison were gathering with arms in their hands and a
sullen expression in their faces.
</p>

<p>
Anon I heard the rolling of drums echoing in the fortifications,
and then the troops fell into their ranks by companies.
The officers who commanded them were no longer
like the decorated chevaliers of old France.  They were
taken from the ranks&mdash;men of the people&mdash;and were divested
of all ornaments, epaulettes, or lace; and as a badge of
office, wore each a tricoloured sash over their plain blue
surtouts; while in scorn of powder and trimming, their coarse
black hair streamed in uncombed masses from beneath their
large cocked hats.  My heart grew sick on beholding them;
for here, as in Paris, it was too evident that the religion of
nature,&mdash;the power of the sovereign people,&mdash;liberty, equality,
and fraternity,&mdash;with other political cant of the time, and
of the murderous sections of the capital, together with
bloodshed, robbery, and outrage, were triumphant and
victorious.  In confirmation of this several cries reached me.
</p>

<p>
"A bas les aristocrats!"
</p>

<p>
"Down with the Red Ribbon!"
</p>

<p>
"Vive le bon citoyen Rouvigny!  Vive la République
démocratique et sociale!"
</p>

<p>
These came chiefly from an excited mob of revolutionists,
who poured like a living tide into the citadel, to fraternize
with the soldiers of the line&mdash;now accepted children of the
new <i>régime</i>.  Among their mass of squalor, rags, and filth,
crime, and intoxication, were hundreds of white women and
French mulatto girls; like the ancient Bacchantes of
Greece, more than half nude, crowned by garlands of vine-leaves,
with wildness in their faces, frenzy in their gestures,
and dishevelled hair; clashing cymbals and brandishing
knives that were stained with the blood of many of the
secular clergy, Jesuits, and wealthiest planters.  They sang
the "Carmagnole," and many obscene ditties, while dancing
and gyrating in mad groups around two ruffians, each of
whom bore upon his pike a human skull.
</p>

<p>
There were the ghastly heads of two of my father's
favourite officers, MM. de la Bourdonaye and St. Julian,
both young and noble gentlemen of Dauphiny, who were
accused of no other crime than being descended from two of
the best houses in France, and who had been murdered in
cold blood in the vaults of the citadel.  In very mockery,
as it were, each poor skull had on a wig nicely powdered,
and loyally tied with white ribbons.  The heads were
borne before a prisoner who was ignominiously bound with
ropes, and led forward between an escort whose bayonets
were fixed.
</p>

<p>
A shriek rose to my lips, but died there, as I clutched
my prison-bars, and swung on them madly; for in this
prisoner, who was greeted with a yell, I recognized my
father&mdash;my father, Louis de Mazancy&mdash;the Sieur de
St. Valliere, the first gentleman of Dauphiny, and Premier
Chevalier of the Grand Cross of St. Louis.
</p>

<p>
Firmly, erect, and proudly, the old man strode to his
doom.  He wore the white uniform of the old French
line.  His hair was powdered and dressed <i>à la</i> Louis XV.;
his orders were glittering on his breast; his aspect was
singularly calm, dignified, and sweetly venerable.  He was
resolved to die with honour to the garb he wore, the race
he sprang from, and the old monarchy of the Capets, the
Valois, and the Bourbon, which, in that hour of shame and
peril, he felt he represented; and, in defiance of the living
tide of <i>canaille</i> who surrounded him, he repeatedly
exclaimed with a clear and loud voice,&mdash;"Vive le Roi, Vive
Louis XVII., King of France and Navarre!"
</p>

<p>
Yells, and the ominous flashing of brandished weapons
followed him; the loud voice of Thibaud de Rouvigny was
heard commanding silence; and he was obeyed, being now
elected commander of the forces in the new republican
state of Martinique.  Such sudden elevations were not
unusual in those days of the subversion of all right and
rule.  A poor sergeant of marines, named Jean-Baptist
Bernadotte, was thus made colonel-in-chief of a battalion of
mutineers, while all his officers were ironed and cast into
prison.  Unlike Rouvigny, who murdered many of his
hapless superiors in cold blood, Bernadotte's first act of
authority, was to order the release and dismissal of all who
bore commissions under King Louis.*
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* I need scarcely remind the reader that "poor" Sergeant
Bernadotte, to whom Eulalie referred,
the most distinguished of all "the
children of the Republic," died in 1822,
Marshal Prince of Ponte Corvo, and King of Sweden.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The unfortunate chevalier saw them take his epaulettes
and sash from his shoulders and tread them under foot;
he saw his sword broken over his head and flung away,
and he only vouchsafed a scornful smile; but when the red
ribbon and gold cross of St. Louis, with its motto <i>Bellicoe
Virtutis Proemium</i>, was rent from his breast, "the iron
seemed to enter his soul," and a scarlet flush rose to his
pale thin temples; for this badge of long and faithful
military service he valued more than all the heraldic
honours of the line of Mazancy.  To have it torn thus from
his breast, and trampled under the foot of Thibaud de
Rouvigny&mdash;the clown whom he had brought from his
Seigneurie in Dauphiny&mdash;the wretch whom he fostered and
promoted&mdash;oh, it was a bitterness too much even for an old
soldier's philosophy.
</p>

<p>
M. le Chevalier Dutriel endeavoured to lessen these
degradations, but the attempt nearly cost him his own life.
</p>

<p>
"My cross," I heard my father exclaim; "take it!
Bravely was it won when leading Frenchmen&mdash;yea, the
fathers of many among you&mdash;at Belleisle, in Western Florida,
and under La Fayette, for the freedom of America.  The
hands of our anointed king gave it to me, and those of rebels
cannot degrade it."
</p>

<p>
"Down with the aristocrat!" cried the troops.
</p>

<p>
"A la lanterne!" added the copper-coloured Bacchantes.
</p>

<p>
"Down with the enemy of France, of liberty, and the
people!" shouted the multitude.
</p>

<p>
My father now proceeded to accuse Rouvigny of ingratitude,
and of seducing the garrison from their allegiance;
but, as in the case of their royal master, the drums were
ordered to beat that his voice might not be heard.
</p>

<p>
Rouvigny now unsheathed his sword, and pointing to the
prison window, on the bars of which I clung, said something
to my father, who trembled and turned towards it.  Still
more to embitter his last moments, the wretch was no
doubt informing him of the vicinity of his only child, for he
stretched his fettered hands towards the grating, with a
piteous expression in his venerable face.
</p>

<p>
"Father&mdash;father!" I exclaimed, but at that moment
Rouvigny forced him down upon his knees; a handkerchief
was bound over his eyes; I saw the gleam of arms as the
firing platoon drew up, and a coffin was borne through the
excited mob, who parted before and collapsed behind it, like
the waves of the sea round a vessel.  I was voiceless,
breathless, powerless!  I could not even pray!
</p>

<p>
I sank upon my knees and muffled my head in the skirt
of my dress, to shut out the dreadful sound that was sure
to follow all I had seen; but <i>that sound</i>&mdash;the death-volley
which slew my father, seemed to split my ears, like rolling
thunder! .......
</p>

<p>
When I looked again, the multitude were yelling and
whooping round a prostrate and bleeding form, which was
thrust into a rude coffin and borne away by black slaves, while
the naked Bacchantes of whom I have spoken danced hand
in hand around it, and, as it disappeared, a blessed
insensibility came over me.
</p>

<p>
Such was the fate of my father, the Sieur de Mazancy,
commander of the royal troops in Martinique.
</p>

<p>
After this, several days passed; of these I have little
other recollection than hearing from time to time sounds of
tumult; the echo of musket-shots, and wild cries from the
town of St. Pierre, where the republicans of all colours were
leaguing with the blacks and revolted troops to destroy the
wealthy planters and their families.  Overcome in mind
and body by the terror I had endured, and a horror of
my present position, I would have sunk altogether, but
for the kindness and ministrations of Benoit le Noir, an
old Obeah negro of my father's, who had obtained the office
of sweeping the prisons and cleansing the scaffold in the
citadel, and who, almost forced me to eat some cakes made
of a delicate fruit, and to drink from time to time the
contents of a gourd bottle, which he carried in his wallet of
grass-matting.  The beverage it contained was vidonia
wine and citron juice, seasoned with sugar and nutmeg; it
refreshed and sustained me, and I remember more than
once drooping my aching head upon the shoulder of this
old slave and weeping bitterly, for in my loneliness I felt
how true it is that,
</p>

<p class="t3">
  One touch of nature makes the whole world kin.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
After the first paroxysm of grief was past and I had
become tolerably resigned, I was visited by Thibaud de
Rouvigny.  I remembered how my father had upbraided
him, and the part he had performed at his execution&mdash;let me
rather call it murder!&mdash;and I received him with coldness
almost loathing.  But he only smiled, seated himself upon
my truckle bed, and persisted in endeavouring to console
me.  Let me hasten over an interview, the result of which
makes me now despise myself!  But, oh, what was I, a poor
girl broken in heart and crushed in spirit!
</p>

<p>
He told me that, as an aristocrat, I was doomed to death
by the laws which had regenerated France; laws, which the
provisional government of Martinique recognized; that the
warrant for my execution had already been signed by <i>him</i>;
but that one way remained by which I could be saved.
</p>

<p>
"A way&mdash;oh! name it, monsieur," said I imploringly.
</p>

<p>
"Marriage with a citizen&mdash;a child of the Republic."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, this is adding absurdity to cruelty&mdash;insult to
misfortune," I replied with clasped hands.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Tonnerre de Ciel!</i> mademoiselle," said he, "or shall I rather
say Citoyenne Eulalie?&mdash;be calm, and listen to a friend."
</p>

<p>
"Friend!" I reiterated with a scornful shudder.
</p>

<p>
M. Rouvigny smiled coldly.
</p>

<p>
He then proceeded to say how long he had loved me;
that he would cast himself and his power (he had succeeded
my poor father in his civil and military authority) at my
feet; but I turned from him with the aversion he merited.
The scar on his brow grew black with rage&mdash;his cheeks
crimsoned and his eyes glared; I was terrified&mdash;yea, fascinated
by fear, even as when yonder horrid reptile reared its
head at me this evening.
</p>

<p>
Alas!  I had not the courage of Charlotte Corday, or
others who, like her, shall live in history.
</p>

<p>
To be brief, I felt myself too young, too unprepared, too
fond of life and full of hope for the future, to die yet; and
to be spared the horror of a public assassination&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She paused.
</p>

<p>
"You consented to marry this villain," said I, with a
tone almost of pique, "this Thibaud Rouvigny?"
</p>

<p>
"I did."  (She shuddered like one in an ague.)  "What
mercy could I expect from Rouvigny?  'Twas his brother
who clove with a hatchet the head of the helpless, innocent,
and lovely Princess de Lamballe, and who held it aloft on a
pike, with her beautiful golden hair waving around the
bloody staff, as he thrust it against the barred window of
that chamber in which Marie Antoinette was seated with
the captive Louis, in the Tower of the Temple.  His family
were all in the sections of Paris.  <i>Mon Dieu!</i> they were a
generation of tigers!
</p>

<p>
"To satisfy my scruples, the curé of the Ursuline chapel
at St. Pierre performed the burlesque of a marriage ceremony
<i>in secret</i>, for all religion is abolished in the colonies as
in France, and thus sanctified, to save my miserable life, I
became the bride&mdash;the victim of Rouvigny&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She paused again and wept, while her flushing face was
bowed upon her snow-white hands.
</p>

<p>
"And this is your story, madame?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"It is a sorrowful one."
</p>

<p>
"God alone knows what may be its sequel."
</p>

<p>
"But you left Martinique&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"A fugitive."
</p>

<p>
"How?"
</p>

<p>
"The coarseness and cruelty of Rouvigny drove me
almost mad, but they supplied me with courage; and three
weeks after my&mdash;(can I call it marriage?)&mdash;by the aid of
Benoit, the faithful old negro, I escaped from the citadel,
and reached a small merchant vessel which was bound for
Havre under American colours.  The master took pity upon
me, for my father had once done him a service.  We put to
sea; a new hope began to fill my heart&mdash;the hope that
<i>freedom</i>, a homeless, friendless, and penniless freedom
inspired&mdash;when, within a day's sail of St. Lucia, we were
captured by the British frigate <i>Adder</i> (whose captain our
false colours failed to deceive), and taken to this island,
where the Governor, in commiseration of my misfortunes,
assigned to me this pretty villa of Roscobelle, and a little
income."
</p>

<p>
"And you are now happy?" said I, taking her hands in
mine.
</p>

<p>
"Almost&mdash;for I am free."
</p>

<p>
"Is this M. Rouvigny still at Martinique?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, as commandant."
</p>

<p>
"Good! we shall soon be there, and perhaps, madame, it
may be my happy lot to avenge you," I exclaimed, with an
ardent impulse which her story and misfortunes both
inspired.
</p>

<p>
Such was the adventurous narrative of Eulalie, ere the
conclusion of which the early hours of morning surprised
us.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXIII.
<br><br>
OUR ESTEEM PROGRESSES.
</h3>

<p>
Her beauty, her winning manner, and a lisping broken
English (for much that she said was in broken English,
though we generally conversed in French), all conduced to
lend an additional charm to this fair foreigner.  Her story
and her friendlessness filled my heart with interest, and
with her image.  After this night, she frequently spoke to
me of Rouvigny, and always with abhorrence; but of her
first love, the Chevalier de Losme, she never spoke again.  I
remarked this, and though I knew that this man had loved
her long ago and was dead, the conviction that she felt an
interest in his memory galled and fretted me.  Why was
this?
</p>

<p>
I leave casuists to determine.
</p>

<p>
This was likely to be my second love affair, for with
soldierlike facility, I had already forgotten poor little Amy
Lee.
</p>

<p>
I had many misgivings regarding Madame de Rouvigny,
fearing that although I had told my junior rank, as I wore
a white jean jacket, she believed I was an officer, and that a
discovery of the truth might lessen her interest in me; but
in this I was deceived.
</p>

<p>
After an almost sleepless night, I was up with early
morning, knowing that I was for guard that day, and sought
the shady verandah which encircled the villa.  There, a
sable negro girl, clad entirely in white, brought me coffee,
and then I was soon joined by my hostess, who bade me
"good morning" with the most charming grace.  She wore
a most becoming morning dress of spotless white muslin,
edged with rich lace, and a jaunty little French cap, beneath
which her black hair was confined in massive braids; her
eyes were sparkling, and her lips were red as those of an
infant.  She had a piquant and coquettish manner, and
sipped her coffee from a tiny china cup, with the prettiest
air in the world.
</p>

<p>
We had a true Barbadian breakfast in the cool verandah;
then Madame assumed her green parasol, and we strolled
towards the avenue, for I could no longer conceal from her,
that however deep my desire to linger at Boscobelle, I was
under the greatest anxiety to reach head-quarters, and report
myself to Captain Glendonwyn and Mr. Rolster, our paragon
of an adjutant.
</p>

<p>
Except a few twisted and broken palm-branches, no trace
remained of the tempest of last night.  The morning sun
was ascending into a clear blue sky.  Refreshed by the
midnight torrents of rain, the trees wore their gayest green,
the flowers their brightest tints.  In the distance, the
sugar-mills were whirling their brown fans merrily&mdash;their brick
walls covered with blue wash, and gorgeous with flowering
creepers and parasites.  The rich aroma of the wild
cinnamon, and of many other spices, loaded the air with
delicious odours, as the soft breeze swept over the island
from the sea.
</p>

<p>
Close by us, were groups of bronze-like negroes chatting
and singing merrily, as they hoed among the tall and bending
sugar-canes, and dug up the ginger roots, which are generally
ripe in March.  The little humming-birds were spreading
their bright winglets on the ambient air, as they roved like
large bees, from one gay flower to another, in search of food;
while the increasing brilliance of the sun, as his beams fell
in broad flakes between the great cabbage-trees, lit up the
leaves, stalks, and petals of the flower-beds, seeming to gem
them round with emeralds and diamonds, for yet the dew lay
deep on every shrub and tree.
</p>

<p>
Near the foot of the avenue, down which we walked
rather silently, we found the remains of our late acquaintance
the snake.  The negroes, I have said, consider such
reptiles sacred, and while Quashi, an old Coromontee, was
interring it with the utmost respect and awe, I examined the
rattle in its tail.  If, as naturalists aver, a fresh joint is
added for every year of life, I judged that this one must
have been at least fifteen years old.
</p>

<p>
Eulalie turned shudderingly away.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it is frightful!" said she, resuming my arm;
"but is it not strange that sweet music is said to appease
them?"
</p>

<p>
"I begin to doubt it."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"This scaly devil approached you while you sang?"
</p>

<p>
"Thanks for the implied compliment, M. Oliver; I hope
you found my voice more musical than the serpent did?"
</p>

<p>
"Its echo shall linger in my ears and heart for ever."
</p>

<p>
Madame coloured, and laughing said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"M. le Viscount de Chateaubriand (who writes so charmingly)
told me, that three years ago, on the banks of the Genesse,
in Upper Canada, he saw the anger of a most ferocious
snake appeased by the music of a common flute on which
was played "Vive Henri Quatre."
</p>

<p>
"Depend upon it, that snake must have been an aristocrat."
</p>

<p>
"True; what music would have appeased a republican!"
</p>

<p>
"And now, madame, with a thousand grateful thanks for
your&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Do not say kindness or hospitality, I beg of you."
</p>

<p>
"What then?"
</p>

<p>
"Gratitude, if you will; for I detest commonplaces,"
said she, casting down her fine eyes, over which their
dark-fringed lids drooped with a charming expression of coquetry
and timidity.
</p>

<p>
"Then, be it gratitude, Madame de Rouvigny."
</p>

<p>
"Call me Mazancy, Eulalie; anything but that detested
name!" said she, shrugging her pretty shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"I shall never forget the charm of your society, or the
interest your unhappy story has created in my heart," said
I, pressing her hand very gently.
</p>

<p>
"Every pleasure of our life is owing to some fortuitous
circumstance," she replied, looking up with a beautiful
smile.  "Had <i>you</i> not rambled heedlessly towards Boscobelle
last night, without knowing why; had <i>I</i> not fallen asleep in
the avenue, we had never known each other.  'Twas all a
fatality which we could not see."
</p>

<p>
"Had I not under Providence saved you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I had perished&mdash;yet what would it have mattered?  I
am an unfortunate creature!  No one can love me, who
has the right to do so&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, madame&mdash;Eulalie," said I, kissing her hand.
</p>

<p>
"What says Marmontel?" said she, withdrawing it
abruptly; "'to confess that one does not love one's husband,
is almost to confess that we love <i>another</i>; and the person
who is made the confident of such a confession, is very often
the object of it, a cruel and dangerous deduction!'"
</p>

<p>
"Dared I flatter myself that such was my case!&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, hush&mdash;<i>mon Dieu!</i> we must not begin to speak
thus, or where shall we <i>end</i>?  I fear you already begin to
deem me hollow as a popo."
</p>

<p>
"As what?"
</p>

<p>
"I forgot that you are a stranger here.  The popo-tree
bears hollow fruit, and here it is the symbol of insincerity."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, madame&mdash;may I never find such in you!"
</p>

<p>
"People will never understand me&mdash;the victim of
circumstances and destiny.  My dear Mr. Oliver, you know not
how <i>triste</i> is the fate of one like me, having a heart capable
of all the love and affection one can feel&mdash;yet thrust back
upon myself, that love and that affection have no legitimate
object whereon to be lavished; thus life becomes a dreary,
dreary void!"
</p>

<p>
It was a perilous style for a pretty woman to adopt, in
addressing an imaginative lad like me: we both became
agitated and coloured deeply; but madame was the first to
recover herself.
</p>

<p>
"Listen to me," said she: "I remember that M. Marmontel
elsewhere says, 'We are naturally disposed to seek
and to believe that we discover in the features of a man,
what we know to be in his heart.'  I sought goodness and
truth in yours, and I do believe that I love you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Love me&mdash;you!" I exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"As a <i>friend</i>&mdash;a dear friend, truly and well, but&mdash;but
leave me just now.  Come in a day or two&mdash;I shall be at
home&mdash;always at home to you, M. Oliver&mdash;I owe you so
much, and I am so lonely here&mdash;oh, so lonely in heart and
soul&mdash;for I have nothing to lean on&mdash;to cling to! adieu, monsieur."
</p>

<p>
She presented her cheek; but her manner, her beauty,
the time, all conduced to bewilder me, and I pressed my
lips to hers, by an impulse which I could not resist, and
rushed from the avenue into the highway, with a speed
that might have made any one suppose M. de Rouvigny was
lurking, blunderbuss in hand behind the cabbage-trees.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXIV.
<br><br>
THE MANGROVE CREEK.
</h3>

<p>
I reached the garrison in time for guard-mounting, and
the storm sufficiently explained the cause of my absence
from quarters.  I had ample time for thought during the
monotony of that day's duty, when with a guard of twenty
rank and file, including my comrade Tom Telfer (now a
corporal), I had charge of various stores, powder, shot and
live shells, which a gang of woolly-headed negroes were
hoisting into the launch of H.M.'s frigate <i>Adder</i>, which was
still anchored ahead of the leeward line, about a mile off
in the bay, where all the fleet were preparing for the
forthcoming attack upon the isle of Martinique.
</p>

<p>
During this important duty, which we superintended
under a sunshine so hot that the barrels and bayonets of
our firelocks actually grew warm in our hands, my mind
never for a moment ceased reverting to the pretty villa of
Boscobelle, and the beautiful young Frenchwoman who
dwelt in seclusion there.
</p>

<p>
Wearily I counted the hours till I could return.
</p>

<p>
Strict orders had been issued against permitting liquor to
be given to soldiers on duty, but so much was I abstracted
from all sublunary matters by the fair image of Eulalie de
Rouvigny, and the whole tenor of my late adventure, that I
was quite oblivious of the fact that some of my comrades
were industriously "sucking the monkey," through the kind
ministrations of two or three pretty mulatto girls.  This
monkey, was a cocoanut-shell filled with coarse rum, to be
sucked at the end through the orifice, which represents the
mouth of an ape.  A discovery of this neglect might have
caused me, in those days, to lose the three stripes from my
arm, and to gain three hundred elsewhere, as intoxication
when on duty, and more especially on foreign service, is a
most serious military crime, and severely was it visited in
those old times of the cat and halberds.
</p>

<p>
I could not conceal from myself, that ruin, misfortune,
and the Revolution had combined to make Madame de
Rouvigny somewhat of a philosopher.  Then, circumstanced
as we were,&mdash;she married to a man whom she hated, and
might never see,&mdash;an exile from a country to which she
could never return; I, a Scots Fusilier, bound on a desperate
service, in a torrid clime of fever and death.  What secret
impulse made me yield to the folly of being attracted or
lured into an amour with her?  What end could it serve?
</p>

<p>
I could not determine this.  I was only eighteen; and at
that age one does not scrutinize too closely.  It may be,
that I was solely actuated by the resolution to enjoy life
while it lasted; as the volunteer of a forlorn hope, sells his
kit and blanket, or spends his last sixpence in roistering at
the sutler's tent, lest it should become the prey of the
plunderer who overhauls his corpse, or the pioneer who
buries it.
</p>

<p>
There was no enthusiasm in my heart for Eulalie, because
I could not deem her that which every lover deems his
divinity to be,&mdash;perfection.  I pitied her friendless condition;
her beauty charmed and her manner won me.  That was
all.  I could scarcely love, in the purest sense of the term,
a woman who had yielded, even under terror of death, to a
wretch, such as she had portrayed Thibaud de Rouvigny
to be.  Any regard I felt for her could not be lasting; and
yet, so inconsistent is our nature, that I departed next day
to visit her, quoting, as I left the barracks, the words of
Rochefoucault, who says tritely, somewhere, "There are few
people who are not ashamed of having loved one another
<i>when that love ceases</i>;" and with this cold aphorism in my
heart, I hastened along the road to Boscobelle.
</p>

<p>
I found madame in her pretty little drawing-room: at the
sight of her all scruples vanished, and I was vanquished by
the charm of her presence and her beauty.
</p>

<p>
Previous to reaching the villa there occurred an incident
which, though it seemed almost trivial at that time, was
connected with some very important events.
</p>

<p>
The heat of the morning was oppressive; repeatedly I
fanned my face with my forage-cap or the leaves of the
large plants that grew by the highway.  The cool umbrageous
foliage of a thicket lured me to halt, to fling off my
shoulder-belt and sword, and to lie for a time under the
shadow of its intertwisted branches.  This thicket clothed
the steep sides of a gully, at the bottom of which rippled a
long inlet, or arm of the sea.  It was a lonely spot, haunted
only by monkeys that leaped from tree to tree, and by
tortoises that crawled upon the shelves of weedy rocks far down
below me.  The steep and volcanic rifts were covered by
wild gourd-vines and those Spanish lemon-trees which usually
grow among rocks and stone.  Arching over this watery
avenue, the depth of which made it seem of inky hue, for
the leaves excluded the sky, were the giant date-trees, with
their fruit in spiral clusters, the pale-green cedar, the golden
orange, and the calibash-tree, with its enormous gourds of
the brightest yellow.
</p>

<p>
I had not been many minutes in this sequestered and
luxuriant place before the sounds of voices and of oars fell
upon my ear, and then a long, low, half-decked boat, built
like an Indian piragua, with her mast, yard, and sail laid
flat, shot into the mangrove creek.  Three men who were
in her laid their oars on board, and by their hands urged
their craft along under the luxuriant foliage and mangroves
which almost concealed the water whereon they floated, and
the long, giant, and wonderful plants that grew upward from
the oozy bottom, and were brushed by the keel as it cleft
their wavy masses.  As these three men passed below me, I
could perceive that one was an old negro, the other was
attired like a French priest, in a long black coat and shovel
hat.  The third, who was well armed with pistols and
cutlass, notwithstanding a black beard, and the addition of a
pair of rings in his ears, I could recognize by his villanous face,
his brawny, bull-shaped neck, and his strange oaths, which
stirred a terrible cord in memory, to be Dick Knuckleduster.
</p>

<p>
The Indian suddenly gave the piragua a lurch that nearly
capsized it.
</p>

<p>
"Halloo, Quashi, Snowball, or whatever you call yourself!"
bellowed Dick, "d&mdash;&mdash;n your stupid optics!  do you
mean to send us all to kingdom-come in this stinking hole,
all bilge and green leaves?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Tonnerre de Ciel!</i>" added the priest fiercely; "mind what
you are about, Monsieur Benoit le Noir, or I'll break every
bone in your black skin!"
</p>

<p>
The priest I had no doubt was a French emigrant, but his
language made me as doubtful of his sanctity as of his object,
which was evidently a secret one, or why all this studious
concealment?
</p>

<p>
"I do right, massa," urged the old negro.
</p>

<p>
"How should you know whether you do right or not?"
growled the Frenchman; "what the devil are you?"
</p>

<p>
"Me your slave, massa," was the submissive and then
common reply.
</p>

<p>
This strangely assorted trio, whose purpose I could not
divine, passed close to me, or at least about twenty feet
below my place of concealment; and, assisted by the weeds
and mangroves which they grasped, dragged their boat
further up this watery gulley or chasm in the rock.
</p>

<p>
Having no desire to renew my acquaintance with
Mr. Knuckleduster, who, no doubt, had deserted from one
of our ships in the bay, as he and his two companions
disappeared under the dwarf mangroves, I sprang up the bank,
reached the highway, and hastened to the villa of Madame
de Rouvigny.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXV.
<br><br>
THE EMIGRANT PRIEST.
</h3>

<p>
"Bon jour, Oliver, mon ami!" she exclaimed, running
trippingly towards me and holding out both her pretty
hands; "I am glad you have returned so soon&mdash;but not
sooner than welcome."
</p>

<p>
I was in a flutter like a young girl, so much did her
beauty, and still more her charming and perfectly confident
manner bewilder me.  Her features were singularly
delicate, and their varying play constituted, perhaps, their
greatest charm.  Her hair was black, soft, wavy, and in
great quantity.
</p>

<p>
"I thank you, madame," said I, in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
"You have found no difficulty in returning?"
</p>

<p>
"We should never find a difficulty in returning to those
we&mdash;we&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Esteem!" she suggested with an arch smile.
</p>

<p>
"Or love," said I courageously, closing my sentence.
</p>

<p>
She coloured deeply, and laughingly replied with that
sentimental air which a pretty Frenchwoman can so readily
assume,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"<i>Grand merci</i>!  Love&mdash;what is it? a spark of the
divine essence&mdash;an emanation from God!  It is an
irresistible fatality&mdash;so Mademoiselle Karalio used to
write&mdash;but we must not talk of it.  And now for luncheon, and
the coolest wines I can give you; for the allowance of the
governor does enable me, though a poor French emigrant,
to keep some very good wine for nay visitors."
</p>

<p>
With my new friend, I spent a day of delight and pleasure
amid the sylvan beauties of Boscobelle.  During the
heat of noon, we read together choice passages from the
"Armida" of Collardeau, from the novels of Marivaux,
and other fashionable but now forgotten novelists of the
days of Marmontel; and we were always amused by the
plots of the latter (Marivaux), which he founded on what
he termed "the surprise of love"&mdash;two persons conceiving
a passion for each other without knowing it, until the last
scene.
</p>

<p>
As the atmosphere cooled when the tropical eve came on,
we walked together in the garden and coppices of
Boscobelle; Madame protected her head by a round straw hat
and broad parasol; and to me she consigned the care of her
little Bologna spaniel.  It was a privilege to have the care
of this animal&mdash;the peculiar pet of a beautiful woman&mdash;the
happy little cur, which lay in her lap nearly all day, and
slept by night near the laced pillow on which her soft cheek
rested&mdash;and which, when not in either place, reposed in her
work-basket (a miracle of weaving, the gift of a poor Carib
woman)&mdash;this little pug, which was the object of a thousand
attentions and caresses, and was seldom out of her white
hands even for five minutes.
</p>

<p>
She told me the names of various gigantic shrubs and
gorgeous flowers, which, in size and luxuriousness, far
exceeded the productions of Europe.  I remember there was
one named the poison-tree, the juice of which is said to
cause blindness if it drops into the eye.  It is graceful in
its foliage, but the negroes fear it so much, that they deem
even its shadow causes death; and then we sat for hours in
a beautiful arbour, concealed by dense hedges of damask
and Provence roses, which flourish there all the year round,
and shrouded still more by the water-lemon flowers that
arched high overhead, and sprang from beds bordered by
red and white lilies, St. Iago flowers, and the Merveille de
Peru, which only opens its purple petals at sunset, and
thus, as madame told me, is named "the four o'clock
flower."  So hour after hour glided away, and I lingered
there absorbed in the charms of her presence, the scene, and
the time, forgetful that in a week hence, perhaps, I would
again be ploughing the sea, in a ship crowded by armed
men, bent on the slaughter of her countrymen.
</p>

<p>
At last the shadows of the tall cabbage-trees began to fall
in long lines across the brilliant flower-beds, the green
shrubbery and the distant fields of sugar-cane, warning me
that night would approach with tropical rapidity, and
that I must be gone.
</p>

<p>
Like one of those hours, the long voluptuous day had
passed, and so I said in a low and tremulous voice, as I
rose to leave Eulalie, for so I had already begun to
name her.
</p>

<p>
"And you love me now," said she, in a breathless voice,
permitting me still to retain her hands in mine; "it is so like
a boy, this sudden fancy," she added, with a timid glance
and a tender smile; "for despite your brown cheek, and
your sub-officer's uniform, you are still but a boy, my dear
Oliver.  You love me, you say&mdash;or your eyes have said so,
almost ere you know what love is."
</p>

<p>
"It is a tie between two dear hearts that seek to
sympathize with each other&mdash;and beat and live for each other
alone."
</p>

<p>
"But my heart, boy, tied as I am to another, is valueless
as the fruit of the Dead Sea."
</p>

<p>
I clasped my hands, and said,&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Speak not thus, Eulalie."
</p>

<p>
"How dare I offer&mdash;how dare you accept it?" she said,
while her tears fell hot and fast.
</p>

<p>
"Dearest Eulalie," I whispered, placing a hand gently on
each side of her waist, "I have it already&mdash;confess to me
that I have."
</p>

<p>
"True."
</p>

<p>
Her head fell on my breast, and I gave way to all the
delight of the moment.
</p>

<p>
"Go, go," she said, while deeply agitated; "leave me now;
all this can end only in our own misery."
</p>

<p>
As she spoke, the distant boom of an evening gun from a
ship off the coast warned me that the sun had set; that I
could have no storm to plead to-night as an excuse for
absence from quarters; and, in the language of romancers,
"I tore myself away," and again took the nearest path to
the garrison.
</p>

<p>
I hurried along immersed in thought.  Regret that I had
ever known Eulalie was my predominant reflection; yet,
had I <i>not</i> known her,&mdash;had I not been cast by fate,
fortune&mdash;what you will&mdash;in her path, she must have perished
under the poisonous fangs of the reptile from which I
rescued her.  Then recalling her own remarkable words,
that "love was an irresistible fatality," I endeavoured to
appease conscience and stifle regret, but in vain; and now I
equally dreaded and longed for the order that would
re-embark the Fusiliers for Martinique.  In that conflict,
which was inevitable, Rouvigny might fall, and she be
freed from the snare which bound her to him,&mdash;but freed,
to what end, to what purpose?  Who was I&mdash;what was I!
Poor, penniless; a soldier whose whole worldly possessions
consisted of a knapsack and sixty rounds of ammunition.
Amid all these reflections and mental queries, did no memory
of Amy&mdash;dear, wee, modest Amy Lee&mdash;my boyish love,
occur to me?  I cannot tell now.  It seemed as if there was
no woman in the world but Eulalie.
</p>

<p>
The summit of a gentle eminence brought me in sight of
Carlisle Bay, where our fleet, in all the pride of British
men-of-war, rode at anchor in two long lines, astern of the
towering three-decker of Sir John Jervis.  They made a
gallant and a stately show, with yards squared and rigging
taught as iron; their scarlet ensigns and white pennants
waving in the wind, and their black cannon peering grimly
through the open ports.  The dark blue water, the reflection
of a clear blue sky, rolled in tiny ripples to the green
copse wood or golden sand which edged the shore.  A white
foam, the precursor of sea breeze, was cresting every tiny
wavelet that came into the lovely bay; beyond the ample
bosom of which the Caribbean sea spread in vast immensity
away, till lost in distance, haze, and the purple glow of
the set sun.
</p>

<p>
At a part of the path where the sugar-canes grew like a
reedy wall on either hand, but still afforded a view of the
anchored fleet, a person approached, in whom, at once, I
recognised the priest, the companion of Dick Knuckleduster,
and the negro, in the boat or piragua, that stole so secretly
along the inlet, under the mangroves and calibash-trees.
He approached a fallen tree on which I was seated, and,
politely lifting his hat, bowed low, and bade me "good
evening," in the purest French.
</p>

<p>
He seemed disposed to enter into conversation, but
though his manner was suave and polite, his appearance
was far from prepossessing.  He was tall, broad-shouldered,
and muscular.  His head was set on a thick bull-neck, while
the conformation of his square jaws, large ears, placed high
and near his narrow temples, with a nose somewhat hooked
yet flattened, gave him a fierce and tiger-like aspect;
which his keen sinister black eyes, and an old wound that
traversed his forehead, in no way lessened or improved.
He was closely shaved, but the roots of his black beard
studded his chin with blue dots as if it had been scorched
with powder sparks.  I had&mdash;I knew not altogether why&mdash;an
undefinable repugnance for, and a suspicion of, this
clerical personage, who deliberately seated himself beside
me, on one of those fallen palms which one may frequently
see after a storm in Barbadoes, where they seem then to
take root at both ends and sprout with renewed vigour.
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur is a Frenchman?" said I.
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur le Soldat is right&mdash;I <i>am</i> a Frenchman."
</p>

<p>
"A rash admission at this time."
</p>

<p>
"Not for one of my mission in life," said he meekly.
</p>

<p>
"You are, I think, a priest?"
</p>

<p>
"Right again&mdash;I <i>am</i> a priest."
</p>

<p>
"An emigrant, of course."
</p>

<p>
"Hélas!  M. le Soldat, yes; a fugitive," said he, bowing low.
</p>

<p>
"From old France?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed!"
</p>

<p>
"I came last from Martinique."
</p>

<p>
"The deuce! from Martinique?" I exclaimed,
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know, or have you seen the villain who
commands in the town and citadel of St. Pierre?"
</p>

<p>
"The villain&mdash;St. Pierre!" he repeated, starting as he
turned fully round towards me; "monsieur uses very
strange language when speaking of a chef de bataillon in
the service of the French republic."
</p>

<p>
"I mean a man named Thibaud de Rouvigny, formerly a
sous lieutenant, who murdered his patron the Sieur de
Mazancy, cruelly betrayed his daughter, and after placing
himself at the head of the insurgents of the city and
mutineers of the garrison, armed all the negro slaves and
murdered the planters."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, monsieur, I have seen the Citizen De Rouvigny;
but he has been superseded."
</p>

<p>
"Ah&mdash;indeed&mdash;by whom!"
</p>

<p>
"General Rochambeau&mdash;not superseded; but the general
being senior, in due course, assumes command of the
Republican troops in the island.  But now that I have
answered your questions," he added, half closing and casting
down his stealthy eyes, "can you inform me where the villa
of Boscobelle is situated?"
</p>

<p>
"I can; but why do you ask?"
</p>

<p>
"I have news for Madame de Rouvigny&mdash;news from
Martinique."
</p>

<p>
"Good news!" I inquired suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
"Why do <i>you</i> ask?" said he, through his clenched teeth.
</p>

<p>
"Because," said I, colouring, "we all feel a deep interest
in her."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Sangbleu</i>! is that all?  Well, I hope the tidings are
good," he replied with a cold smile.
</p>

<p>
"Unless they be that her dog of a husband is dead, I
don't know anything else that would interest her much
from that island of revolt and crime."
</p>

<p>
"Well, monsieur," said he, with a sardonic grimace,
"suppose that it were so?"
</p>

<p>
"That Rouvigny is dead!" said I, starting up.
</p>

<p>
"Moderate your transports, M. le Soldat," said the priest
coldly, while grasping my arm with fingers like a vice, and
while his eyes glared fiercely into mine.  "This Thibaud de
Rouvigny&mdash;this leader of the mob&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Who murdered the venerable Louis de Mazancy in cold
blood&mdash;well&mdash;well&mdash;what of him?"
</p>

<p>
"Is sorely prostrated by a yellow fever, and may never
recover."
</p>

<p>
"Good news for us."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Tonnerre de Ciel!</i>" grinned the priest, "and for all who
love&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What?" I demanded furiously.
</p>

<p>
"Only the cause of royalty, monsieur," he replied, with an
extremely low bow.
</p>

<p>
"We sail for your island in a short time."
</p>

<p>
"I hope your armament is strong."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, strong enough to eat up all the Frenchmen in the
Antilles," replied I, with true British confidence.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Bon Dieu</i>!  Your strength?"
</p>

<p>
"We have twelve or fourteen battalions of the line, three
three-deckers, six frigates, some of them double-banked, and
transports without end."
</p>

<p>
"How many soldiers, think you?"
</p>

<p>
"About fifteen thousand," said I gaily.
</p>

<p>
"And seamen, how many?"
</p>

<p>
"Rather more than half that number."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Vive le Roi!</i> the tricolor must certainly go to the
wall.  How many pieces of cannon?"
</p>

<p>
"I know not," said I, fearing that I had already been too
communicative to a stranger.
</p>

<p>
"Madame Rouvigny has been very useful to your government,
I believe?" said he, with the air of one who makes a
casual inquiry.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, exceedingly so; her information concerning
Martinique and Guadaloupe has proved invaluable to the
general and admiral&mdash;at least, so rumour says."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" said he, with a French grimace; "and her
Boscobelle&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Lies there," said I, pointing to it.
</p>

<p>
"Where?"
</p>

<p>
"Amid yonder tall cabbage-trees that tower above the
sugar-canes."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, M. le Soldat," said he, raising his hat.
</p>

<p>
"Adieu, M. l'Abbé."
</p>

<p>
We bowed, and separated.
</p>

<p>
"What the deuce can this grim and ugly padre want
with Eulalie?" thought I, while hurrying along.  "And so
her husband is ill&mdash;dying of yellow fever; <i>bon voyage</i> to
you, M. le Chef de Bataillon!" added I, while some very
brilliant ideas occurred to me.
</p>

<p>
After we were a mile or two apart, and I was close to
the garrison, the main guard of which were closing the gates
for the night, I remembered again the suspicious manner in
which, I had first seen this priest in the mangrove creek;
his strange bearing, his companionship with Knuckleduster,
his questions and my unwary answers:&mdash;all rushed upon me,
with a flood of alarming suggestions and vague terrors of his
secret purpose and real character; but it was too late to do
anything for that night.
</p>

<p>
On entering the fortress, its gates were closed behind me,
and as a sequel to my unpleasant thoughts, Sergeant
Drumbirrel informed me, that the general order for the whole
forces to embark on the third day ensuing, <i>at latest</i>, had
been issued; and thus I knew, that in a few hours Eulalie
and the Barbadian shore would be far behind me, for
ever.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXVI.
<br><br>
THE SPY.
</h3>

<p>
Next day, the garrison at Needham's Point; the white-tented
camp upon the flat green shore; the stately fleet in
the bay; and all the harbour of Bridgetown, the mole and
the carenage, presented a scene of unwonted bustle, while a
thousand boats were dashing to and fro, with their
broad-bladed oars flashing in the sunshine; many had the scarlet
ensign flaunting at the stern.  Amid them were launches
and piraguas manned by negro slaves, conveying stores,
ammunition, orders, provisions, and all the requisite material
for the arduous service on which we were so soon to depart.
</p>

<p>
Various duties detained me at head-quarters until the
heat of noon was past, when I hastened to pay a visit to
Eulalie&mdash;a visit which I felt painfully conscious would be
my last, as the Fusiliers would be one of the first corps
probably to embark.
</p>

<p>
The conviction that in France, or in its colonies, I could
not have had such free meetings with Eulalie, lent our
friendship an additional charm.
</p>

<p>
"Courtship and marriage in France," says a recent writer,
truly, "are surrounded by so many forms, that it may be
doubted whether the original legislators did not consider
them a sort of <i>crime</i>, and it may also be doubted whether
the difficulties with which they are surrounded have not
had their expressive social consequences."
</p>

<p>
My acquaintance with Eulalie savoured of the romantic,
and I dearly loved all that had the air of adventure, such
being more valuable to me then, than all the gold of
Australia&mdash;"Ormuz and Inde" are out of fashion now.  The
piquancy of her foreign manner, the luxuriance of the
country, the softness of the climate, and the novelty of our
situations, predisposed us to regard each other with a tender
interest, which was strengthened by her horror of her
deceiver, Rouvigny.
</p>

<p>
I had such an undefined dread of the priest who accosted
me, yesterday, that on hastening down the tall "cabbage
walk" towards the villa, when I saw its white walls and
green blinds, its verandah covered by lemon-water flowers,
and Provence roses, all in their usual state of repose, and no
sign of alarm or dismay about the place, I experienced
a relief at heart, and gaily knocked at the door.  A
few minutes after found me by the side of my charming
French friend, who was as gay and smiling,&mdash;as full of
alternate sentimentalism and <i>espiéglerie</i> as ever, until I
crushed her vivacity by announcing our speedy departure.
</p>

<p>
"For Martinique?" she exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; and for St. Lucia, Guadaloupe, and all the
Leeward Isles in succession."
</p>

<p>
"Alas! what dangers are before you,&mdash;war and fever by
sea and land; we shall never meet more, M. Oliver!  Our
term or little time of joy is past!" she exclaimed, with
clasped hands.
</p>

<p>
I then inquired about the priest,&mdash;the bearer of tidings
from St. Pierre.  She seemed astonished, and declared that
no such person had been at Boscobelle.
</p>

<p>
"Strange," said I, and then related the two occasions on
which I had seen him; first, in the mangrove creek, and
secondly on the highway where we had conversed near the
fallen palm-tree.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Grand Dieu!</i> this is most singular," exclaimed Eulalie,
her large dark eyes dilating with wonder; "do me the
favour to describe his appearance."
</p>

<p>
In as few words as possible I did so; and while she
listened she grew very pale; her eyes filled with an
expression of terror, and she exclaimed, with a piercing
accent,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'Tis Thibaud de Rouvigny you have met!"
</p>

<p>
"Rouvigny&mdash;impossible!"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing wicked or adventurous is impossible to this
man," she answered mournfully.
</p>

<p>
"He here&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And disguised, too."
</p>

<p>
"What can his mission be?"
</p>

<p>
"To spy upon your forces,&mdash;perhaps to compass my life."
</p>

<p>
"Eulalie, dear Eulalie!  he <i>did</i> ask many questions
concerning you."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Heavens! then I am lost!  Oliver, do not leave me
at this crisis."
</p>

<p>
"He dare not approach you, while under the protection
of the British flag."
</p>

<p>
"There it is&mdash;<i>mon Dieu!</i> that is my crime.  Envious,
malignant, subtle, and vindictive, Heaven and his own heart
can only tell his present object; but be assured he has not
lost sight of me.  Alas! you know him not, as I so fatally
know him; and thus, you cannot conceive the deep-laid
plans and carefully-developed cruelty of which he is capable.
Rouvigny here&mdash;even here!  Then again I am a prey to
terror, to mistrust, and to misery.  But <i>you</i>, Oliver&mdash;you
will not, <i>must</i> not leave me," she added, clinging to me in
undisguised fear and desperate hope.
</p>

<p>
I gazed upon her beautiful face, her upturned and soft
beseeching eyes, and the orders of the general seemed to be
written in letters of fire before me.  I could only press her
to my breast and remain silent.
</p>

<p>
"You mentioned a negro being in the boat with him?"
said she.
</p>

<p>
"A negro, whom he named Benoit."
</p>

<p>
"Benoit le Noir?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Eulalie."
</p>

<p>
"My father's old slave, who tended me in prison and
assisted me to escape from St. Pierre, and who afterwards
became the property of Rouvigny.  A fresh corroboration
that this pretended priest is my tormentor."
</p>

<p>
"Had I but known this yesterday, the rope of the provost
marshal's guard would have made short work with the spy."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  <i>Mère de Dieu</i>!  Do not talk so; for this man's
life is indissolubly connected with mine."
</p>

<p>
"Some friendly ball, at present lying quietly in an
ammunition-cask, may break the spell, Eulalie."
</p>

<p>
She covered her face with her tremulous white hands,
and sobbed heavily.
</p>

<p>
I shall not occupy time in relating how unavailing, by
the pressure of necessity, were the tears and entreaties of
Eulalie, that I should remain for her protection, or how
graceful were the prayers she put up for my safety,
when she found that I must leave her; and how charming
were the whispered promises, that whatever fate had in
store for her, she would write to me often&mdash;oh, very often,
and remember me for ever; that she would keep a little
journal of all her lonely thoughts, and on each anniversary
of her patroness, St. Ursule, she would say a novena, or
nine-days prayer, for me and my prosperity.  Poor Eulalie!
</p>

<p>
Her earnest words, her musical accents, her tender
expression, and the chaste features of her pale, sad face, sank
deeply into my memory, as I kissed her on the lips and eyes;
and we parted, both in tears, for I was still but a boy.
</p>

<p>
Years have passed since then, and many more may pass,
but I never shall forget the hours of delight that I spent
with the unfortunate Eulalie.
</p>

<p>
I hurried from the villa, and almost ran towards the
town; but as the distance increased between us, my steps
became slower, and, from every little eminence, I gazed
regretfully back to the lofty cabbage-palms and the
orange-groves of Boscobelle, all darkening now, and deepening in
the rapid twilight of a tropical evening in March.  The
white walls of the villa had disappeared amid the sombre
foliage; but I knew that <i>she</i> was there, where I might
never be again.
</p>

<p>
At last I reached the fallen palm by the way-side, where,
yesterday, the priest, or the disguised Rouvigny, had met
me, and there again I turned to take a farewell glance.
</p>

<p>
Boscobelle and its groves were alike lost in darkness now;
but soon my heart throbbed with a new anxiety, on beholding
the glow of a conflagration, tinting all the calm sky
with red and orange-coloured flame, and throwing forward
in black and strong outlines several intervening objects, and
this alarming light seemed to rise from Boscobelle!  I gazed
on it, wavering, irresolute, and almost trembling with
anxiety.  My limbs faltered, and I nearly made a retrograde
movement, when the deep boom of a heavy gun, whether
from the garrison or the fleet I know not, pealed through
the echoing sky, and died in distance far away, recalling me
to a sense of duty; and I hastened to Needham's Point,
where we spent our last night in Barbadoes, as an express
order had come for the troops to embark on the morrow.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXVII.
<br><br>
ANXIETY.
</h3>

<p>
The sun was yet far below the horizon of a sea that, like
the sky above it, presented a purity of blue, which still, on
each successive morning, excited the wonder of the European,
when, by beaten drum and the ringing Kentish bugle in camp
and fort, and all along the echoing shore, the various corps
of Sir Charles Grey's army were roused from slumber, and
summoned to their colours; while, on a gun being fired from
the ship of Admiral Jervis, all the boats of the fleet shot off
simultaneously, to convey them on board.
</p>

<p>
I have already mentioned that the <i>Adder</i> frigate lay
nearest to the shore in the leeward line; thus we, the
Fusiliers, were on the extreme left flank, when drawn up on
the beach for embarkation.
</p>

<p>
Already our restless fellows had forgotten their long
sea-voyage; already they were tired of garrison routine, and
longed to be at the enemy.  After three hearty cheers, we
departed from the fort to the beach in heavy marching
order, with our band playing and colours cased; and forming
close column, halted; then, by successive companies, we
were embarked in the boats of the <i>Adder</i>.
</p>

<p>
Fifteen thousand men were there under arms&mdash;their
bayonets flashing in the sun.  A few years after, and what
had war and pestilence left of all that glittering host?
Hecatombs of rotten bones, when the roll of their
"spirit-stirring drums" was lost in the silence of their graves by
sea and shore; for Rochambeau and Rouvigny, who commanded
in Martinique, and Ricard in St. Lucia, with Victor
Hughes in Guadaloupe, were all skilful and resolute officers,
who promised to give us pretty hot work before we could
add these isles to the empire of the Queen of the Sea.
</p>

<p>
Glendonwyn's company was in rear of our columns, and
from its other supernumeraries I stood somewhat apart, and
full of my own sad reflections, gazing abstractedly on the
exciting scene, the brilliance of which surpassed all I had
conceived, as the cloudless sun arose in all his glory from
the West-Indian sea; while each long and sharp-prowed
boat, crowded with red-coats, its flashing oars moving with
the regularity of some vast and many-footed monster, cleft
the clear water of the bay.  The brass bands were all
playing, and cheers were ringing incessantly along the sunny
shore, and on board the armed fleet.  The scene was, indeed,
most glorious and inspiriting; but I thought only of the
sad young Frenchwoman, of the sorrowful story she had told
me of her hopeless future, and the hours of delight we could
never spend together again.
</p>

<p>
Under Captain Macdonald, of Kinlochmoidart, our first
company had already embarked, and the column was closing
up, when an aiguiletted officer, who wore a brilliant staff
uniform, and whom I knew to be Lieutenant Harry Smith,
of the Scots Royals, and aide-de-camp to Sir Charles Grey,
rode hurriedly up to the Earl of Kildonan.
</p>

<p>
"My lord," I heard him say, "I have a message to you
from the general."
</p>

<p>
"An invitation to a Barbadian breakfast, eh?" replied
our colonel laughing, as he patted the curving neck of his
beautiful black horse; "champagne, coffee, ham, and guaya
jelly; pine-apples, citron, and limes."
</p>

<p>
"Nothing half so pleasant," said the handsome young aide
smiling; "but we require twenty rank and file of your
Fusiliers for immediate duty."
</p>

<p>
"At the moment of embarkation! an odd request."
</p>

<p>
"We want them without delay, by desire of his excellency
the governor."
</p>

<p>
"You will have the goodness to explain."
</p>

<p>
"Nearly the whole garrison are employed at the boats or
on fatigue parties to day, and he requires one officer and
twenty Fusiliers for a few hours.  They will be back ere the
last company is embarked."
</p>

<p>
"And this duty?"
</p>

<p>
"An outrage of a dreadful nature was committed last
night, a few miles from Bridgetown."
</p>

<p>
"Where?" asked the earl.
</p>

<p>
"At a villa named Boscobelle."
</p>

<p>
My heart died within me at these terrible words; but
restrained by etiquette and by that force of habit which
discipline impels, I dared not speak; but the <i>memory</i> of the
shock these words gave me still vibrates in my heart.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed!" exclaimed the earl.
</p>

<p>
"Madame de Rouvigny," continued the aide-de-camp, in
the most easy and conversational way, "a French emigrant
lady&mdash;and, by the bye, a devilish pretty woman&mdash;has been
carried off in the night&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Carried off!"
</p>

<p>
"Or murdered; we know not which, as her body
cannot be found, and her residence has been burned to its
foundation."
</p>

<p>
I leave the reader to imagine how these dreadful tidings
chilled my heart.
</p>

<p>
"Murdered&mdash;carried off&mdash;a lady!" reiterated the earl.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;deuced unpleasant affair," yawned the staff officer,
of whom I have more to relate elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
"By whom?"
</p>

<p>
"Runaway negroes&mdash;Caribs in their piraguas&mdash;perhaps
by pirates, or French privateersmen;&mdash;by whom we know
not; but as it is thought they may still be lurking in the
cane-fields or thickets, some twenty rank and file of
yours&mdash;all active fellows&mdash;are wanted to scour the bush
thereabout.  Please to detail them at once, my lord; they will
not be long detained."
</p>

<p>
"Instantly," exclaimed the earl, wheeling round his
horse.
</p>

<p>
"I know this place called Boscobelle, my lord&mdash;permit
me to go?" I asked breathlessly.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, Ellis; you're a smart lad," said the earl;
"and I like to find a soldier always ready."
</p>

<p>
How little could our colonel fathom the cause of my
readiness and anxiety&mdash;my burning impatience to be gone!
</p>

<p>
Old Glendonwyn gave Lieutenant Haystone the right
section of our company; we threw off our knapsacks,
haversacks, canteens, blankets, and all that might impede
us.  I relinquished my sergeant's pike for a musket.  We
loaded with ball-cartridge, and thus, under my guidance,
twenty of the Fusiliers went off, double-quick, towards that
place so well known to me, the residence of Eulalie.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXVIII.
<br><br>
A REVELATION.
</h3>

<p>
The fleetest railway speed would have seemed slow to
me as we hastened towards the scene of last night's outrage.
It was soon reached, and as we hurried down the avenue
of cabbage-trees we became sensible that the odour of
burned wood, canes, and bamboo, predominated over all the
fragrance of the herbs and flowers with which the morning
air was laden.  An exclamation of mingled rage and sorrow
escaped me on beholding the site of the once pretty cottage
or villa.
</p>

<p>
The verandah and porch, the wooden columns and cane
trellis-work of which had been covered by luxuriant masses
of lemon-water flowers and the ever blooming roses of
Provence, had all disappeared; so had the white wooden walls
and broad, green Venetian blinds.  A few blackened stumps
that stood among heaps of mouldering cinders were all that
remained of the home of poor Eulalie.
</p>

<p>
And where was she?
</p>

<p>
The garden and avenue were strewn by broken pictures,
music, volumes of Marivaux, Racine, Molière and Madame
de Genlis, thrown out by the negro servants, a few of whom
sat near the smoking ruin, crouching on their hams, and
regarding us with such fear and doubt that some time elapsed
before we could get any explanation from them.
</p>

<p>
At last Lieutenant Haystone contrived to glean from
Quashi the Coromantee, who seemed less terrified than the
rest, that they had been startled at nightfall by the shriek of
a woman and the crashing of glass.  On this they all trembled
very much, believing it the white devil of the buccra
men, who always comes when there is thunder, and the
heavy wind that bends and uproots the big palms; but,
gathering courage, after a time they hastened to the room
of their mistress.  It was empty! her bed was in
disorder&mdash;the furniture overthrown&mdash;a Venetian window dashed to
pieces, and portions of her night-dress adhering to the
fragments evinced that she had been roughly dragged through
it, and across the garden, footsteps being discernible on the
trampled flower-beds.  These led them towards the avenue,
from searching which the sable domestics were recalled by
an alarm of fire, and on returning found the whole villa in
flames.  It burned rapidly.  Quashi could tell us no more&mdash;an
Obeah nigger might, but there was no Obeah at Boscobelle
just now.
</p>

<p>
Previous to our arrival, I related to Haystone and my
comrades some of the circumstances connected with my visits
to the villa, dwelling particularly on my two meetings with
the supposed priest.
</p>

<p>
"You should have reported all this to head-quarters,"
said Haystone, "then perhaps this outrage might have been
prevented."
</p>

<p>
"True," said I sadly; "I know not what impulse led me
to conceal circumstances so full of suspicion; but 'tis
useless to reproach me now."
</p>

<p>
"Our orders are to search the woods and sugar-plantations;
you will extend from the right, and separate by files.
The fallen palm on the high road shall be our point of
rendezvous in half an hour hence.  Make prisoner every
suspicious-looking person&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But," said one of the fusiliers, "in case of resistance?"
</p>

<p>
"Give them a prick with your bayonet&mdash;we have no time
to lose here.  Away, then."
</p>

<p>
We separated by twos, and while some dived at once into
the long green masses of waving sugar-canes, others into
palm, orange, or chestnut-groves, I, with the assistance of my
Coromantee friend, endeavoured to trace further the footsteps
he had detected on the flower-beds; but, alas! all
vestiges of them disappeared on the gravel of the avenue.
We searched long without discovering any other clue.  My
soul was heavy, and my heart sick to death.  I heard my
comrades shouting and laughing as they met each other at
intervals in the bush, and envied their heedless fun as they
pelted with stones or fallen nuts the chattering monkeys
which sprang from tree to tree, and in turn mocked and jibed
them, or swung by their claws and tails from the branches.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, the old Coromantee (some of whose former
savage instincts were here of service) detected among the
long thick grass that grew by the wayside, beyond the
"cabbage-walk," traces of feet and of the leaves being crushed,
as if some one had been dragged over the ground there, and
keenly he followed this clue or trail.  Here a bruised blade
of grass, there a broken twig of the wild tamarind, or a
crushed gourd-vine, served to lead him on; and from point to
point he traced them, with his gleaming eyes and his flat,
red, dilated nostrils close to the earth, as if he scented
footsteps like a Spanish blood-hound, till all clue vanished again
at the deep gully in the mangrove creek, where I had seen
the piragua of the pretended priest, guided under the
luxuriant weeds and wild palm-branches to its place of
concealment.
</p>

<p>
The Coromantee pointed to the black weedy profundity of
the water below us, and was silent.  The place and his action
filled my mind with vague but terrible suggestions.
</p>

<p>
I knew not what to decide upon, and stood by his side,
leaning on my musket, bewildered by grief for the mystery
that overhung the fate of Eulalie.  Suddenly a shout above
roused me!  It was the cheerful voice of Tom Telfer.
</p>

<p>
"Ahoy," cried he.  "Hallo, Ellis,&mdash;look out&mdash;stop that
fellow!"
</p>

<p>
Having descended far into the gully, I looked up, and saw
a man pursued by several of the Fusileers.  He and they
came plunging down the steep and rocky side of the wooded
chasm, through thick mangroves, and a literal jungle of
twisted creepers, of wild vines, cucumbers, gourds, and
ginger-roots, all flourishing in matted masses, under a shade so
dark, that the wild tamarinds kept their leaves closed, as at
night.
</p>

<p>
"Fire, Oliver, fire!" cried Tom, as the fugitive, who
seemed like a seaman, drew a pistol from his girdle and
discharged it full at my head; but I had already levelled my
bayonet at him breast-high, and in my bewilderment at
the same time, discharged my musket, the bullet of which
whistled past his left ear.  The two reports, as they rang
in that deep and narrow gorge, woke a thousand
reverberations, scaring from the trees the brown monkeys, the
white sea-gulls who were lured there by the solitude, and
clouds of little humming-birds, with their tiny pinions of
crimson, gold, and emerald green.  Fortunately, the
fugitive's bullet missed me, and before he could cock a second
pistol, I had knocked him down with my clubbed musket.
</p>

<p>
On his being collared and roughly dragged to his feet by
Tom Telfer and a few others, I found myself confronted by
my old acquaintance Mr. Richard Knuckleduster.
</p>

<p>
"We found him lurking under some broken palm-branches,
a little way up the gulley," said Tom, breathlessly; "he
bolted as soon as he saw us&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, that looked suspicious."
</p>

<p>
"And so, Ellis, we gave chase."
</p>

<p>
"He is one of the very men we are in search of," said I;
"and I know him to be a murderer, a thief, and a deserter
from the service.  Bring him to Mr. Haystone, and if he
makes the slightest resistance, bayonet him without
mercy."
</p>

<p>
We soon dragged him to the highway, and at the fallen
palm, found Lieutenant Haystone seated, with his jacket
unbuttoned, a cigar in his mouth, and in his hand a large
plaintain leaf, with which he was fanning himself, as the
atmosphere was now close and sultry.
</p>

<p>
"Hallo&mdash;a prisoner!" said he, starting up.
</p>

<p>
"We roused him in the gully, sir," said Telfer, as our
party all came rapidly in; "and Ellis says that he knows
him well."
</p>

<p>
"Is this the case, sergeant?" asked the officer.
</p>

<p>
"It was he whom I saw in the piragua, accompanied by
the Frenchman and negro.  I know him, moreover, to be a
deserter, a robber, and perhaps worse."
</p>

<p>
Knuckleduster bestowed on me a savage scowl, and then
burst into a fit of gruff and contemptuous laughter.
</p>

<p>
"Come, sirrah," said Haystone, "this insolent bearing
will not better your prospects; remember that a court-martial
and the lash are before you, so answer me in a straight-forward
manner.  Know you aught of the persons who committed
the outrage last night at Boscobelle?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied the ruffian, grinding his fanglike teeth,
"and may every danger dog them in this world with damnation
in that to come&mdash;if so be, as the parsons say, there is
another."
</p>

<p>
"A charitable wish!" said Haystone; "if this spirit
animates you, we may perhaps arrive at the truth."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps," sneered the ruffian.
</p>

<p>
"Then who were they?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I suppose I may as well make a clean breast of it.
They were Frenchmen from Martinique."
</p>

<p>
"And you served them?"
</p>

<p>
"Poor devils must do queer things sometimes."
</p>

<p>
"You&mdash;a deserter?" continued Haystone furiously.
</p>

<p>
"I defy you or any man to prove that I deserted," said
the fellow sullenly.  "I was lying out on the foreyard-arm
of the admiral's ship, in a night when it was blowing a stiff
breeze, and we were ordered to reef topsails.  I fell away
to leeward and dropped into the sea, when we were close to
St. Lucia.  The ship never lay-to, but the lieutenant of the
watch tossed a hen-coop over to me, and with its aid I got
ashore and was made prisoner by the Johnnie Crapauds,
as you might have been had the misfortune been yours.  But
I was a pressed man, and no doubt may be marked as having
run on the purser's books.  I was sent in irons to
Martinique.  There a French officer, whose wife was a prisoner
here, stated that he wished to set her free, though, as I have
since thought, it was to punish her, as an enemy of the
Republic and a spy of the British Government, for I had
heard she had become both."
</p>

<p>
"The Colonel de Rouvigny?" said I.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that is his name.  He promised to pay me handsomely,
if I, with a few others, would work a little schooner,
<i>Les Droits de l'Homme</i>, from St. Pierre to Barbadoes.  I
hoped to make my escape and volunteered to serve him.
She was a queer craft we manned; low in the water, with
raking masts, a fast sailer; painted white on one side and
black on the other, for she had been fitted out by some of
the pirates on the Spanish main.  Howsoever, it seemed better
to be aboard o' her, than to work like a slave among French
niggers at the new batteries of St. Pierre.  We reached
Barbadoes.  The schooner, with American colours flying,
came to an anchor in a lonely bight about six miles off; but
kept close in shore among the weeds and dwarf mangroves;
and then we&mdash;that is, Monsieur Rouvigny, three negroes,
and I&mdash;came off here, in a kind of punt, they call a
piragua.
</p>

<p>
"Three negroes," said I; "there was but one with
you&mdash;-old Benoit le Noir."
</p>

<p>
"The others were squatted under the plaintains at the
mouth of the gulley."
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;proceed."
</p>

<p>
"If the colonel got clear off with his pretty wife, I was
to get a hundred francs and my liberty; but I got mightily
disgusted with his French lingo&mdash;his parleyvooing and his
hat-off nonsense, which we Englishmen never like&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"We&mdash;speak for yourself Mr. Knuckleduster," said
Haystone.
</p>

<p>
"I wish to tell you all about it, just as it happened."
</p>

<p>
"How delightfully disengenuous!" said Haystone, with
contempt; "though we cannot place over-much reliance on
what a scoundrel so thorough-bred may tell, fire-away."
</p>

<p>
I was on thorns as it were, until the fellow with provoking
slowness continued his story.  With all his ignorance
and brutality of disposition, he was sufficiently acute
to perceive how his narrative wrung my heart.  He smiled
and grimaced as he resumed, and this, in the meantime, was
his revenge on me for twice capturing him.
</p>

<p>
"For two or three days we hung about the villa, hiding
in the shrubberies and among the sugar-canes, without
finding a good opportunity for nabbing the lady, as she
always kept close inside, or if she did come out, was always
attended by an old Coromantee nigger, or by our friend the
sergeant here&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What&mdash;by <i>you</i>, Ellis?" exclaimed Haystone, with such
surprise that he nearly dropped his cigar.
</p>

<p>
"Rascal!&mdash;you saw me then?" said I.
</p>

<p>
"Ay&mdash;morning, noon, and night.  Pretty often Monsieur
Rouvigny and I have been within arm's length of you, when
you and she used to sit in the garden bower, with your
arms round each other, reading books in the French lingo,
chattering like two monkeys on a cabbage-tree, or caterwauling
to the banjo&mdash;guitar I s'pose you call it; and it
was as much as I could do to keep him from pistolling you
both outright, while he swore and <i>sacréd</i> like fury, for
he is a desperate fierce thief, that colonel.  Last night,
when his patience became exhausted, and mine too for
the matter o' that, he resolved to make a dash for the
prize!  Mounseer knew where Madame's bedroom lay on
the ground-floor.  He found her green blinds unfastened.
We crept in and found her snug in her berth asleep.  I
drew back the curtains, and very pretty she looked with
her black hair all braided smooth ways round her head,
under a dainty bit of nightcap&mdash;far too pretty to be the wife
of a Frenchman, say I.  But now, the word was presto!
</p>

<p>
"We dragged her from bed&mdash;then she shrieked out; but
I took the bandanna from my neck, and tied it over her
mouth.  One of our niggers stupidly smashed a window
with his woolly head, and created an alarm; so, to make
a diversion, and enable us to get clear off, the colonel threw
the night lamp into the lady's bed, and, in a twinkling, set
the curtains, the room, and the house in a blaze!  We
dragged her out of the window in her night-dress, across
the flowers and bushes, and carried her off bodily on our
shoulders along the highway, till we reached the gully,
where the piragua lay moored under the mangroves.  The
poor thing was silent now, and offered no resistance, when
she found <i>whose</i> prisoner she was.  My eyes! she seemed
to have a woeful terror of that man.  He too, was silent,
or only <i>sacréd</i>, and twisted his thick upper lip where the
hair was shaven off, when he disguised himself as a French
parson at St. Pierre.
</p>

<p>
"We put her on board the piragua; the colonel and his
three niggers jumped in; I was about to follow, for, look
you, I had not been paid a stiver of the hundred francs,
and began to fear that after this affair the climate of
Barbadoes might prove too hot for me; but what think
you the infernal treacherous frogeater did?  He clubbed a
pistol and struck me down senseless among the mangroves.
Then they shoved off and pulled away to seaward to reach
his schooner, which was hull-down when I saw her this
morning about daybreak, and bearing away north-and-by-west.
Here, among the mangroves I lay until you fellows
found me.  This is all my story&mdash;a pretty one aint it,
Master Oliver Ellis?"
</p>

<p>
"For what purpose did the Frenchman carry off his
wife in this outrageous manner?" asked Mr. Haystone.
</p>

<p>
"To punish her for levanting from him and for becoming,
as he said, a spy."
</p>

<p>
"Punish," said I anxiously; "but how?"
</p>

<p>
"By heaving her overboard, with a cold shot at her heels,
or by marooning her on some rock&mdash;there are lots o' them
among the Windward Isles, where the bones of the
marooned may lie for years, as white as coral.  I have seen
them myself many times in these here Indian isles and in
others up the Gulf of Florida, where they have lain since
the days of the old Buccaneers, when Captain Kidd sailed
in his frigate, the <i>Vulture</i>&mdash;ay, damme, that I have!  The
colonel often spoke of serving her so, if he found a bit of
convenient rock far out at sea with nothing on it but a
coating of guano, seaweed, and barnacles, and, mayhap, a
petrel or two perching atop of it, and there leaving her to
die&mdash;for he swore she should have a terrible end&mdash;and he is
just the man to give her one.  Now that I have payed
out all my yarn, hand over hand, without any rigmarole or
nonsense, what do you mean to do with me?"
</p>

<p>
"Send you on board the ship of Admiral Jervis,"
said Haystone, who ordered him to be secured by a
musket-sling.
</p>

<p>
We marched hastily back to the sea-beach, and delivered
up our prisoner to a party of marines from the admiral's
ship.
</p>

<p>
After the dreadful story I had heard, how terrible were
the thoughts that crowded on me!
</p>

<p>
I pictured in fancy poor Eulalie in the power of this
merciless Frenchman and his callous negroes, flung, pinioned,
into her watery grave, and sinking without a hand to save
her&mdash;sinking to sleep, far down amid the oozy and
mysterious depths of that hot sea, where flourish a myriad of
giant plants that almost reach its surface&mdash;and as she sank
perhaps becoming, ere dead, a prey to the horrid shark.  But
even these ideas were less terrible and less agonizing than
the awful thought of her perishing miserably on a lonely
rock&mdash;marooned&mdash;to die alone, unseen, unwept-for&mdash;to die
of hunger and thirst&mdash;of horror and despair!
</p>

<p>
Thus wrath and just vengeance filled my heart, as the
<i>Adder</i> squared her yards, and the whole of that crowded
and magnificent fleet sailed out of Carlisle Bay, and bore up
for Martinique.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXIX.
<br><br>
A SEA OF FIRE.
</h3>

<p>
We sailed from Barbadoes about sunrise on the morning
of the 3rd of March, and sternly I rejoiced that the distance
between us and the land of our conquest and, as I hoped,
of retribution, was so short.
</p>

<p>
All were now on board again, and as we left Carlisle Bay
and gained the open sea, the cheers we exchanged rang
merrily from ship to ship.  Bridgetown, with its little spires,
the windmills, the mole and forts, disappeared, as the bay
seemed to close its arms, and the undulating line of coast
diminished to a low dark streak, when evening found us
again ploughing the sea of gold and azure, with the
bright-hued dolphin dashing through the brine, and the silver-scaled
flying-fish springing like a work of enchantment, from
wave to wave:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A feeble thing,<br>
  With brine still dropping from its wing,<br>
  Just sparkling in the solar glow,<br>
  To plunge again in depths below.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
We had a fair wind, and by lying well to the westward,
saw the fading rays of the setting sun gild the two high and
conical hills of St. Lucia&mdash;the Pitons&mdash;which are covered
from the beach to their summits with the greenest foliage;
but these darkened and seemed to melt away as the cloudless
sun went down beyond the burning sea, while afar off
on our larboard quarter a crimson gleam shot at times
across the horizon.  It came from the flaming crater of La
Soufrière in St. Lucia, where clouds of burning alum,
sulphur, and cinders are hourly spouted to the sky.
</p>

<p>
I was detailed for the middle watch, and, apart from all,
trod to and fro on the lee-side of the main-deck, full of my
own thoughts; for at such a solitary time they came thick
and fast upon me&mdash;memories of the lost Eulalie&mdash;of my
mother's quiet home, and fancies of the dangers that
were now before me, and which every day became more
imminent.
</p>

<p>
St. Lucia had faded into the sea astern.
</p>

<p>
It was not without emotions of strange and undefinable
interest, that I gazed upon those isles and the ocean that
washed their burning shores.  My memory was filled with
stories of Raleigh; of Vasco de Gama, who doubled the
haunted Cape of Storms; of Nunez de Balboa, who, clad in
his armour, toiled in search of the long fabulous Southern
Sea; of Kidd, the daring pirate, of the early navigators,
of the old buccaneers, of marooned men and the savage
Caribs, who roasted and devoured their prisoners.  For these
isles of modern wealth and slavery were the ancient arena
of battle, storm, and wild adventure, where sunken wrecks
laden with golden doubloons and silver dollars, were lying in
many a bight and bay; where fables said that treasures
buried in the sand were guarded by the spirits of murdered
men; where olive-coloured mermaids whilom sat upon the
rocks and sandy keys, luring mariners to destruction, even
as the syrens did in the classic days of old.  Such scenes
and stories were always associated in my mind with memories
of Selkirk and Robinson Crusoe, who, in my boyish dreams,
I was wont to consider a very happy fellow indeed in having,
as some one says, "a whole island all to himself;" but of
this kind of happiness the reader will hear more at a future
time.
</p>

<p>
I remember we passed a lonely little isle, whereon a
Spanish hermit had dwelt for years, subsisting on fruit, fish,
and tortoises.  His dwelling was constructed with the bones
of a stranded whale; and a large wooden cross, which he
had toiled to erect as a landmark from the sea, could still
be discerned through our telescopes.  But to resume.
</p>

<p>
The night was soft, and the atmosphere, even at that
distance from the land, possessed the warmth and perfume
peculiar to the tropics and to the isles of the Antilles.  The
heat of the air was tempered by the breeze that swept over
the rolling waves from shores laden with the fragrance of
fruit and spices, that had basked the livelong day under the
sun of a cloudless sky.
</p>

<p>
The watch on deck was numerous; but in a large frigate
it was easy to seclude oneself and give way to reverie.  In
the clear light of the stars, her cloud of snowy canvas
swelled out upon the breeze, and as she rolled slightly on
each successive billow, the reef-points on the full white
bosom of every shadowy sail waved slowly to and fro like
silken fringes.
</p>

<p>
To windward lay the long line of the fleet&mdash;each ship
following the other in silence, like white and noiseless
spectres of vast stature, gliding over the solemn sea; and no
light was visible now, save the red spark of a lantern at the
mainmast-head of the admiral's stately three-decker.
</p>

<p>
As we proceeded, the sea began gradually to assume a
very remarkable appearance.
</p>

<p>
Gradually, the wake of every ship&mdash;that long white path
of boiling foam which seems to run astern, became a line of
apparent fire&mdash;alternately brilliant and lurid, then pale and
ashy in hue.  This increased rapidly, till every ridge of water
became a dancing line of red light&mdash;every wave a crimson
cone, based with emerald green, till gradually the whole sea
around the ship became a sheet of seeming fire.  Amid this,
gigantic monsters, wavering and misshapen in form, gleamed
terribly as they shot past in pursuit of each other.
</p>

<p>
These were merely <i>fishes</i> and animalculæ which were thus
magnified by the effect of this wonderful phenomenon.  Every
rope that trailed overboard was covered with flaming light.
Flames seemed also to adhere to the ships' sides, and the
spray that flew over their bows and cat-heads, seemed sparks
of living fire.
</p>

<p>
The wonder and beauty of this terrible scene drew
exclamations of astonishment from all who were on deck; but
after we had sailed a few knots further, the sea of light
gradually faded away, and long ere the night-watch were
piped down, the waves that rolled around our armament,
seemed by contrast darker than ever.
</p>

<p>
This afforded great matter for speculation among the
seamen and Fusiliers of the middle watch; and it was in
vain that I endeavoured to explain the theories of the
phosphorescent or luminous sea, by describing the
light-emitting faculties of the myriads of animalculæ, fish, and
slimy substances that float in its depths; for an old tar, who
was a great authority on all matters pertaining to salt
water, in H.M.S. <i>Adder</i>, asserted on his "solemn davy
'twarnt no such thing&mdash;but was a spell laid on the water
in these here parts in the old times by some buccaneer,
whose ship had been burned after plundering a church in
St. Lucia, and had gone down with all hands on board, and
in flames of fire to the bottom of the sea, where she would
continue to burn till the day of judgment, when we would
all be piped out of our graves on deck."

<h3>
CHAPTER XL.
<br><br>
THE LANDING.
</h3>

<p>
We had a noble run, for the wind continued fresh and
fair, we never lifted tack or sheet the whole way, and one
morning I was roused early by the announcement that
Martinique was in sight.  This was on the morning of the
5th of March.
</p>

<p>
I hastened on deck and could distinctly see the Cardinal's
Cap, the most lofty hill in the isle of St. Martin (and a
good landmark for mariners) ascending slowly from a sea
empurpled by the yet unrisen sun.  Since we had left
Carlisle Bay, no sail, save the fleet, had been visible.  I
thought of Rouvigny, whose fleet schooner <i>Les Droits de
l'Homme</i> could not be many hours ahead of us&mdash;if indeed,
he had shaped his course to Martinique&mdash;and I hailed the
rising land with a glow of stern hope.
</p>

<p>
As the fleet drew nearer to the shore, two other mountains
became visible&mdash;the highest being Mont Pelee, a dormant
volcano, as lofty as Ben Nevis.  It is covered with dark
copsewood the density of which attracts the clouds, and
from its steep sides innumerable streams descend to water
the broad savannahs, where the yellow canes of Java and
Tahiti were waving in the breeze, and those fertile fields
where coffee, cassia, cotton, and maize are cultivated.
Savannah is an old Spanish word, signifying a plain as
smooth and level as a <i>sheet</i>.
</p>

<p>
The race of Caribs in Martinique had long since been
totally exterminated; but stories of them, preserved in the
voyages of the Buccaneers and the wars of the Spaniards,
invested with a species of romance the conical hills of the
island, as they rose, higher, greener, and more defined from
sea.  In the "Excellent Treatise of Antonio Galvano," which
contains a history of navigation from the floating of the Ark
to his own time in 1555, we are told that the "Caribees
are good warriors, who shoot well with the bow; but they
poison their arrows with an herb, whereof he that is hurt
dieth, biting himself to death as a mad dog doth;" and
Peter Martyr, another veracious chronicler, states that
Martinique was once inhabited by women <i>alone</i>.
</p>

<p>
Nearer we drew, and ere long the windmills and houses,
the cocoas and palms tossing their broad and fanlike
branches, became visible.  Then a fort or two, with the
tricolour of France waving; and as the wind fell or began
to change, and the spicy fragrance of the land reached us, the
admiral fired a gun, and signalled to haul up the courses and
shorten sail.
</p>

<p>
The beach of scorched sand seemed white as snow; above
it was the wooded country, where forests of strange large
leaves were tossing in the wind; and further off still,
mellowed faint and blue in cloud and distance, were the
summits of the Cardinal's Cap and Mont Pelee, the volcano
whose terrors slumbered till 1851.
</p>

<p>
The fleet, according to an able plan arranged by our
general, Sir Charles Grey, and our admiral, the valiant old
Sir John Jervis, divided into three squadrons, for the
purpose of assailing the island (which is thirty-five miles in
length by fifteen in breadth*) on three points, and thus
distracting the defence of the troops under General
Rochambeau and Rouvigny.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* According to Captain Gardiner, thirty-nine miles in length by
twenty-one in breadth.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
One portion of the expedition, led by Sir Charles Grey in
person, by Lieutenant-General Prescot, and Brigadier-General
Whyte, having with them the 2nd battalion of Light
Infantry, the 15th Foot under Colonel Symes, two hundred
seamen armed with pikes and pistols, several detached
companies, and two amusettes, landed at Le Cul de Sac Marin,
on the south coast of the island.  There they drove the
French back on every point, and established batteries on
Mont Mathurine; there two howitzers, served by the
seamen, under Captain de Rousigne, of the Royal Artillery,
demolished the works of the enemy on the Pigeon Isle,
where two French companies, after a heavy fire of shot and
shell, surrendered.  By this success, the great bay of Fort
Royal, with the town and citadel, were opened to our fleet.
Immediately after this, the 15th regiment, led by Major
Lyon, stormed the heights of Le Grand Bouclain, killing the
enemy in great numbers, and taking their colours,
ammunition, and cattle.
</p>

<p>
At the same time, a second squadron, under Major
General Thomas Dundas, of Fingask, colonel of the 68th,
but formerly of the <i>old</i> 80th, or Edinburgh Regiment, the
veteran comrade of Cornwallis, with the 9th and 70th
regiments, the 1st Light Infantry, and 2nd Grenadier
Battalion, bore away to the northward, and effected a
landing at La Trinité, and stormed Morne le Brun, under a
heavy fire of musketry; carrying all the works, cannon, and
stores, and driving Bellegarde, the captain of the free
blacks from the mountain fortress that bore his name.
Colonel Campbell, with five companies of Light Infantry,
seized Colon during the same night; and, there, the
grenadiers of the 33rd would have been cut to pieces, but
for those of the 38th, under Captain MacEwan, who rescued
them from an attack of the ferocious Bellegarde and his
savages.
</p>

<p>
The <i>third division</i>, with whose operations I was more
immediately connected, as the Scots Fusiliers formed a
part of it, with a battalion of Grenadiers, the 43rd Light
Infantry, the marines, and other troops, under Sir Charles
Gordon, and Captains Rogers and Cranky, of the navy,
stood close in shore to the south-east, creeping almost
at the foot of the two giant Pitons, with orders to force a
landing at Caise des Navires,&mdash;the same place where, on a
former occasion, our regiment had landed under General
Bruce, but were overwhelmed by the number of the
enemy.
</p>

<p>
While the <i>Adder</i>, and other ships forming our portion of
the armament, kept off shore during the 5th, 6th, and 7th,
hovering near the Diamond Rock, which is usually covered by
wild pigeons, and threatening a small redoubt in the bay of
St. Anne, we heard, repeatedly, the boom of the cannon on
Mont Mathurine, and the patter of musketry in the distance;
and though we knew not how the fortune of war went with
our comrades, we longed to rejoin and unite our strength
with them; nor did the grim preparations made by Dr. Splints
and the medical staff, the packing of lint, rolling of
long-tailed bandages, the formation of stretchers for the
wounded, by tying blankets to sergeants' pikes, which were
to be borne by the bandsmen, in any way daunt our ardour;
and a general joy spread from ship to ship, as the squadron,
which had been standing to the northward, put about, when
the night of the 8th of March came on, moonless and almost
starless, for hazy clouds overhung the giant hills of
Martinique, as we ran close in shore.
</p>

<p>
Then in silence, the boats were lowered, filled with
thousands of soldiers, marines, and seamen, all with their arms
carefully primed and loaded, and were pulled away towards
Caise des Navires, where a stream which flows down from
one of those stupendous sugarloaf-shaped mountains, Les
Pitons du Carbet, falls into the sea, about four miles
westward of the citadel of Fort Royal.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap41"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XLI.
<br><br>
LA CHAPELLE.
</h3>

<p>
When the drums were beating in every ship, previous to
our landing, there occurred a singular circumstance.
</p>

<p>
An officer of ours, Lieutenant Bruce, was in his cabin ill
with fever, and in the highest state of delirium; but,
inspired by the unusual commotion about him, and by the
long roll of the drum, that reverberated between the
echoing decks, he sprang from his cot, dressed and armed
himself, and to the astonishment of all appeared with his
company.  This exertion Dr. Splints averred saved his life,
by carrying off the fever; but left him weak as a child.
</p>

<p>
No cheering was permitted, and in silence and with
rapidity the boats in succession glided under the shadow of
the lofty land, and entered Caise des Navires, a small bay
having a strip of level beach, that was screened by thick
woods from the occupants of certain batteries which had
been erected at Point Negro, between it and Fort Royal.
</p>

<p>
Outside, the stars were shining with all their Indian
brilliancy on the sea.
</p>

<p>
A deep, voiceless, and solemn silence lay over everything;
the sky, where crapelike clouds were floating&mdash;the heaving
sea, and the wooded shore.  We heard only the drip of the
water as it fell from the blades of the feathered oars, and
the clatter of the latter in the rowlocks, as we glided into
the dark bay, gazing keenly the while at the impending
rocks, and striving to pierce the gloom which shrouded
them, as we expected every instant to see the red flash of a
field-piece, and the water torn up, or a boat dashed to
atoms by a round shot; but we landed unmolested, and
formed by companies as quietly as if in a barrack-yard at
home.
</p>

<p>
The company of the gallant Kinlochmoidart was the first
of ours ashore.  In the next boat were forty of our
company, with Captain Glendonwyn, Lieutenant Haystone, and
Second-Lieutenant Bruce, who carried the King's colour;
the Master of Glenluce bore the other.  We, being all
Scotsmen, gave the latter his title, though it was never
recognized by Government, having been granted in 1791
by the Cardinal Duke of York, at Frascati, for the services
of his family to the House of Stewart.
</p>

<p>
The water ran with a gentle ripple into the bay; the air
was laden by the fragrance of a thousand aromatic plants
and trees and flowers, in full bloom and luxuriance, with the
dank dew distilling from their pendant leaves, that had
been palpitating and shrivelling during the past day under
a hot and cloudless sun.  Now, as we mustered fast, the
cry of the scared pigeon began to wake the silence of the
night, as it rose at times from the groves of the mahot-trees
(the bark of which is manufactured into ropes), and
our men were turning over and tossing aside the lazy
tortoises that crawled upon the white sand.
</p>

<p>
The battalions were soon formed.  We were without
guides&mdash;in the dark, and in a strange land; we knew not
what were the intentions of our brigadier, Colonel Sir
Charles Gordon, who now took the command, and still less
did we know how soon we might be engaged; but he did
not keep us long in suspense.  During the day, having seen
by his telescope, from the crosstrees of the <i>Asia</i>, a 64-gun
ship, that a body of French troops occupied the great road
to Fort Royale and the heights above Caise des Navires, he
resolved to move towards the higher mountains and turn
their flank.  Trusting to his own observations and
reconnaissances made from the seaward, he rode at our head
when the march began, and after pursuing for some time the
course of the river which flows into the bay, and the banks
of which were bordered by groves of bananas and Indian
figs, and in the steeper places by wild coffee and tobacco
plants, we attained more open ground, and toiling on in
heavy marching order, reached the first base of the Pitons
du Carbet, from whence we could see the sails of the fleet
our home upon the waters, glimmering white and ghostlike
in the pale starlight.
</p>

<p>
I was sergeant of the advanced guard.
</p>

<p>
Sir Charles, a sharp-eyed and grey-haired old soldier,
rode near me, and I must own to experiencing an excitement
of the keenest description, as we advanced in silence
along the narrow path that led to the mountains, where we
hoped to attack the enemy.
</p>

<p>
Across this path I remember seeing a narrow black line,
which curled, rose, fell, and then passed away.
</p>

<p>
"Look out!" said the general; "that was a snake."
</p>

<p>
The solemn palms were drooping and motionless.  Against
the sky, about seventeen miles distant, the red summit of a
volcano was glowing and emitting gleams of sulphurous
light, such as one may see at times from the cone of a
furnace.  In these gleams, when looking back, I could see the
bayonets of our columns glittering as they poured along the
mountain-side.
</p>

<p>
Ere long, night began to give place to morning.  A single
star shone long and brilliantly amid the azure vault above us.
Then rays of golden light began to play upon the sky, which,
like the sea, became gradually purple and saffron, as the
dawn of morn drew near.
</p>

<p>
Now some wild hogs started from a thicket of mangroves
and passed us grunting and squeaking.
</p>

<p>
"Halt&mdash;look out&mdash;step short!" said several officers, while
Harry Smith the aide-de-camp daringly made a dash forward
to reconnoitre, as this indicated men being in our vicinity;
but these proved to be only a few runaway negroes, who fled
at our approach.
</p>

<p>
As day began to break, the tops of the stupendous Pitons
became grey, then green, for they were shrouded in
broad-leaved foliage; then red and fiery, as the sun arose, and
darkness, like a crape screen, receded down their sides into
the valleys below, where the rivers Lezarde and du Petit
Bresil flowed through the fertile savannahs to the sea.  We
saw the sea itself, rolling like a sheet of rippling light
towards the shore as we gained the heights, and then a cheer
burst from the men of the advanced guard.
</p>

<p>
The enemy were in sight!
</p>

<p>
About a mile distant, at a place named La Chapelle, we
saw several regiments of the French line drawn up in order
of battle, with fieldpieces on their flanks.  The morning sun
was shining full upon them.  Being clad in dark uniforms,
they had a sombre aspect, but we saw their bayonets and
steel ramrods flashing in the light as they loaded to receive
us.  We now halted till the regiment came up.  It was the
leading column of Gordon's brigade, and an emotion of pride
glowed within me at the splendid and service-like aspect of
these thousand Scotsmen in their red coats and high black
bearskin caps, all unwearied by their night-march up the
mountains, with the old white cross of St. Andrew waving
in the early breeze of morn above them, when the young and
gallant earl, their leader, gave the order to form open column
of companies, and from thence to deploy into line double-quick
as the French were unlimbering and wheeling round
their artillery.  There was a flash in front, and then a
humming sound in the air overhead as a twelve-pound shot
passed us and tore up the turf in our rear.
</p>

<p>
Another came!  The direction was better, but not for us,
as it struck on the head a poor fellow in our company named
Graham, and killed him on the spot.  He fell, and the line
passed on, leaving him in the rear.  There was a suffocating
tightness in my throat and breast as I looked back.
</p>

<p>
Poor Graham was lying as still as death could make him,
"with his back to the field and his feet to the foe."  His
bearskin cap had fallen off, and his yet nervous fingers
grasped his undischarged musket.  Where were now his
pride of youth, or <i>esprit de corps</i>?&mdash;his obedience to
discipline and to orders?  He, who a moment before had been a
living man, an ardent soldier, full of health and high
spirit&mdash;he whose thoughts in that dread time had been,
perchance, where mine were, at his mother's lonely hearth and
home, in Scotland, far away, was now a shattered corpse, and
left unburied on a foreign shore.  A soldier fell out of the
ranks and lingered for a moment beside him.
</p>

<p>
"Who are you?" asked Lord Kildonan as he rode past.
</p>

<p>
"Sandy Graham's comrade, my lord," replied the man,
while a tear stood in his eye, and he placed a broad plantain
leaf over the disfigured features of the slain; "he had a
sough in his heart that he would die in Martinique, and so
has it e'en come to pass."
</p>

<p>
This was the first man I had seen killed on service, and
his fall made a deep impression upon me.
</p>

<p>
The battalions of the 43rd Light Infantry, the Grenadiers,
and the Scots Fusiliers being now formed in line,
advanced rapidly towards the foe.  On our right a
body of seamen and marines from the <i>Asia</i> and <i>Adder</i>, led
by Captain Rogers, of the navy, outstripped us in their
eagerness to make a dash at the French cannon which
bowled away in security, until we came within range of
musket-shot, and opened a deadly fire upon them.  The foe
returned this with equal spirit, as the orders of the officer
in command were to protect the trunk road, and prevent us,
if possible, from falling down on Fort Royal on one hand,
or assisting General Dundas, who was then crossing the
island to assail St. Pierre, on the other.
</p>

<p>
In those days we were inspired by a deep-rooted contempt
for and rancorous aversion of the French people; nor were
they much behind us in cherishing the same silly sentiments;
thus both nations were animated by a political and religious
hatred, which the newspapers&mdash;anonymous antagonists at all
times&mdash;left nothing undone to fan and confirm.  In the times
of Pitt and Fox none could foresee the days of Sebastopol,
or the field of Inkermann, when the English Guardsman,
the kilted Highlander, and the French Zouave, would rush
side by side as comrades in the charge.
</p>

<p>
Many brave officers and men of ours were now falling
fast, as the French fired rapidly, and maintained the while
an incessant whooping and yelling, amid which we could
distinguish some of the popular cries of the period.
</p>

<p>
"Vive la République!  Vive les sans cullottes!  A bas
les tyrans!  A bas les Bourbons!  Vive la France, le
diable, et la gloire!"
</p>

<p>
As the clouds of white smoke that rolled along their line
were blown aside by the morning wind, we could see their
excited ranks, clad in the blue uniform of the Republic, with
large red worsted epaulettes, cocked hats worn crosswise,
and garnished with tall red feathers, their long black hair
untied and floating down their backs, their wild and fierce
faces embrowned by a tropical sun, their moustaches matted
thick by the powder of the cartridges they had bitten.
</p>

<p>
Amid them, on horseback, was a dark and sallow officer of
considerable stature.  In an instant I recognized him to be
the Colonel de Rouvigny.  The name of Eulalie was on my
lips&mdash;and my heart glowed with a desire for vengeance, for
now I had been too long under fire, and seen too many fall,
and too much blood and death and agony, to feel the least
compunction or mercy.
</p>

<p>
He wore a tricoloured scarf, and was brandishing his
sabre to encourage his men.  I marked him well, primed my
musket afresh, and raising it carefully to my shoulder, was
taking a deliberate aim at his head, when I was struck to
the earth by a ball in the chest.  I knew not at the time
that it was a half-spent ball, or that my buff belt had
protected me from vital injury, but with the confused&mdash;the
stunning sense of <i>being hit</i>, I staggered on my hands and
knees, over killed and wounded men, to the rear.
</p>

<p>
"God&mdash;I am shot!" was my only exclamation as I gasped
for breath, and placed a hand upon the contused place, while
all my thoughts fled <i>home</i>&mdash;my mother and sister&mdash;their
voices, their faces&mdash;and my past life, in all its most trivial
incidents flashed like a vision before me!
</p>

<p>
"Only a spent ball, Ellis," said Tom Telfer cheerfully.
"You'll be all right in a minute&mdash;hold up, like a man."
</p>

<p>
"Here, my lad, take a pull at my canteen," said a marine
of the <i>Asia</i>, who was hastening forward; "you'll find
something in it better than sangaree."
</p>

<p>
He held the little wooden barrel to my lips, and a draught
of brandy-and-water revived me.
</p>

<p>
"Now, I knew that would make you well, sergeant."
</p>

<p>
Some memories of his face and voice now came before me.
</p>

<p>
"Jack&mdash;Jack Joyce," said I, "don't you know me?"
</p>

<p>
"Not I, sergeant, but we meet so many on sea and
land&mdash;in ship and garrison."
</p>

<p>
"I am Oliver Ellis, who was with you on board the
<i>Tartar</i> tender."
</p>

<p>
"What! you&mdash;little Oliver, whom I helped to slip his
moorings and run from the <i>Tartar</i> cutter, when we were off
the Sandridge light!"
</p>

<p>
"The same," said I.
</p>

<p>
"Give me your hand," exclaimed the warm-hearted
fellow, "who could have expected this!&mdash;what odd things
do happen in the sarvice to be sure!  But we have no time
for talking here&mdash;for the shot are sowing all the turf about
us as thick as peas&mdash;we'll have a yarn when we beat these
fellows and halt."
</p>

<p>
I now resumed my musket&mdash;having given my pike to
form a stretcher&mdash;and hastened forward; but was too late
to share in the brilliant charge, by which, at the point of
the bayonet, Lord Kildonan with the Scots Fusiliers, and
Colonel Myres with the 43rd, drove back the foe in disorder
and precipitation, from their position at La Chapelle, while
their cannon were all taken by the seamen and marines of
the <i>Asia</i> and <i>Adder</i>.
</p>

<p>
Our column then reformed, and over the most difficult,
steep, and rocky ground, under a hot morning sun, we
followed the fugitives beyond the heights of Berne, leaving
the plateau in our rear dotted by long lines of killed and
wounded, in blue and red uniforms,&mdash;but the number of the
former greatly preponderated.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap42"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XLII.
<br><br>
A PAIR OF COLOURS.
</h3>

<p>
"Well, boy," said the Earl of Kildonan, when I brought
him the casualty list of our company, "what think you of
your first engagement?"
</p>

<p>
"I think it horrible, my lord," said I; "and I shall have
this slaughter before me for the rest of my life."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense!" replied the earl, laughing; "you will soon
consider such an affair a mere brush, my lad&mdash;a flash in the
pan."
</p>

<p>
Without food or refreshment we now pushed on, through
difficult ground, torn by volcanic throes into deep chasms
and stony gullies, where watercourses brawled, and on the
sides of which the wild vine and tobacco-plant grew in
luxuriance; over the heights of Berne, above Ance la Haye,
following the retiring French without a check, until we
came upon a village with a spire in its centre, and a battery
of guns on a turf wall in its front.  This place was named
Cayman.  The fire of the battery mowed down some of our
men; but Kinlochmoidart with his company made a rush
and carried it at the point of the bayonet, driving out or
slaying the defenders.
</p>

<p>
As we proceeded through the village, a mulatto child that
strayed into the street between the cross fire of the retiring
enemy and ours, was saved by Jack Joyce, the marine.  On
this, the French for a time ceased firing, and we gave him
an applauding cheer, in which the French joined.
</p>

<p>
"Spike the guns on the turf wall," said Sir Charles
Gordon; "this battery is useless to me."
</p>

<p>
"The devil!" exclaimed Haystone; "here are the guns
taken, and we have not a nail to spike them with."
</p>

<p>
"Next time you come into action, be sure, my lad, and
bring a pocketful," said Glendonwyn laughing, as we knocked
off the trunnions, and again resumed our advance upon Fort
Royal.
</p>

<p>
It was midday now, and the heat of the sun was great.
Our poor fellows, laden as they were, and weary with toiling
over such rough ground, and maintaining a desultory skirmish
with the retiring French, suffered considerably from
thirst; but the wild tamarinds, citrons, and beans, afforded
them some refreshment; and a few ate the tender sprouts
of the young palms, which were procured for them by some
negroes, who followed us in search of occupation, or more
probably of plunder.
</p>

<p>
On both sides of the highway we passed ruined farms and
sugar-mills, where the proprietors had been slain as royalists
by the republicans, or as white men by the blacks and
mulattoes of Bellegarde, with whom the military murderers
of the old Sieur de Mazancy had fraternized.  A great
body of these free blacks had been armed with muskets and
bayonets, to act in concert with the troops of the republic
against us, and wild, subtle, and savage antagonists we found
them in every encounter.
</p>

<p>
It was after we had passed the burning village and
dismantled battery of Cayman, that a terrible&mdash;but, for me,
fortunate&mdash;incident occurred.
</p>

<p>
We were marching by fours through a sequestered place,
where, on one side, the sugar-canes grew high and dense;
while, on the other, a steep and rocky bank, covered by wild
mangroves, laurel-bushes, and gourds, sloped abruptly upward
on our left, and was crowned by some lofty palm and cocoa-trees,
the broad branches of which hung pendant and drooping,
as there was not a breath of air to stir them.  A hoarse
shout that rose suddenly from the rear and centre of the
regiment, caused me and all who were in front to pause
and look back.
</p>

<p>
A savage negro of Bellegarde's force, as the tricoloured scarf
across his bare black chest informed us&mdash;for this appendage,
with a pair of red striped breeches, formed his sole
attire&mdash;sprang from among the sugar-canes, and, flourishing a sharp
sabre, by one deadly stroke&mdash;as a Malay might handle his
crease&mdash;cut the Master of Glenluce, our junior
second-lieutenant, who bore the regimental colour, across the
stomach, severing all the intestines and slaying him on the
instant.  He was a mere boy, being two years younger than
I; but brave, handsome, and soldierly.  The negro tore the
standard from his hands and sprang up the rugged precipice,
with all the agility of a monkey, escaping a shower of
musketry, which, as the men in their hurry and confusion
fired with fixed bayonets, fell all wide of the aim.
</p>

<p>
"A hundred guineas for the colour!" exclaimed Lord
Kildonan, leaping from his horse, which could never have
clambered up the face of the basaltic precipice.
</p>

<p>
With several of ours, who had thrown off their knapsacks,
bearskins, and everything that might impede them, I
sprang away in pursuit.  Being more active and lithe than
my companions, I soon distanced them in climbing with
my musket slung, and in my energy using hands as well
as feet to ascend the steepest part of the rocks.  The
firing ceased now, for the sable assassin with our colour had
disappeared, having concealed himself under some of the
luxuriant masses of foliage, or in one of the clefts of the
rock.
</p>

<p>
Breathless, bathed in perspiration by heat and excitement,
I struggled up the flinty bluff, grasping the wild vines,
creepers, and yellow gourds, that matted all its front; filled
with ardour by the opportunity afforded me for distinguishing
myself in the face of the whole brigade, which was now
halted on the road below, inspired by emulation to maintain
the distance I had already placed between myself and the other
pursuers; and not without some dread the while, of seeing
the bronze-like form of the giant negro appear suddenly
above me, brandishing his reeking sabre, against which, in
an arm so powerful, I could have offered but a meagre
opposition.
</p>

<p>
I was close to the summit of the rocks, and already had
my hands on the projecting roots of the nodding palm-trees
that fringed the summit, when, on chancing to look back, I
saw the negro with the standard, crouching behind a mass
of basaltic rock, on a little plateau, some twenty feet or so
below me.  His sharp crooked sabre was in his hand;
his glossy black eyes were fixed upon me with a bloodshot
and upward glare, and in his face there shone a grin of
triumph.
</p>

<p>
I almost laughed on finding the sanguinary wretch so
completely in my power.  Placing my heels firmly upon the
strong branch of a gourd creeper, with my back against the
wall of rock up which I had been clambering, I cast about
my musket, looked carefully to the priming, cocked, and
just as he was in the act of springing at me, sabre in hand,
I fired!
</p>

<p>
With a bound into the air he fell on his back, with
the flag below him, and beating the earth wildly with
his bare heels, while blowing blood and foam from his mouth
together.
</p>

<p>
A clamour from the regiment rose upward, as I fixed my
bayonet and descended to where the fallen assassin&mdash;a
gigantic Angola savage, formed like a Hercules, and dark as
if hewn from the blackest marble&mdash;was lying.  I approached
cautiously, and not without fear that he might yet rise and
spring upon me, even when in the throes of death, for I
knew well how subtle these people were.  After an
irresolute and anxious pause of nearly a minute, I passed my
bayonet through his body, which was then lying still and
motionless.  I thought it shuddered, and I am certain that
I also shuddered, when thrusting him over the precipice
into a black chasm, where a mountain torrent rushed
towards the Cul de Sac Royal.
</p>

<p>
On picking up his weapon, it proved to be a beautiful
French sabre, the hilt of which was covered with elaborate
silver ornaments.  Among these I perceived a coronet,
and on the blade the name of "Louis de Mazancy;" and
then a pang shot through my breast, for this sword had
evidently belonged to the father of Eulalie, and was a relic of
her family.
</p>

<p>
Descending the rocks, I rejoined the still halted regiment,
and placed the blue silk standard, heavy with its embroidered
thistles, the cross of St. Andrew, and the trophies of
"Quebec" and "Belle-Isle," in the hands of the earl, who
stood with a group of officers around the mutilated body of
Glenluce, who was now cold, pale, and dead.
</p>

<p>
"You are a noble fellow, Ellis," said he, "and have bravely
won the hundred guineas.  I would rather have lost a
thousand than one of my colours."
</p>

<p>
I reddened deeply, and, while panting with exertion,
replied,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Excuse me, my lord&mdash;but this&mdash;this money you speak
of&mdash;I would rather die than accept it!"
</p>

<p>
"How?"
</p>

<p>
"Change of situation can never make me forget that I
am&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What?" asked Kildonan haughtily.
</p>

<p>
"A gentleman," said I, bowing.
</p>

<p>
The earl bowed in return, with a smile of pleasure.
</p>

<p>
"Let this money," I resumed, "be given to the widows of
the regiment, my lord"&mdash;(my emotion became deeper)&mdash;"could
I accept <i>money</i> for the rescue of the same colour
which my father carried under yours at the siege of
Belle-Isle?"
</p>

<p>
"Bravo!" exclaimed the officers, clapping their hands.
</p>

<p>
"Pardon the offer, Ellis&mdash;you are right," said the earl;
"so truly can I appreciate the spirit which animates you,
that I now promise you shall carry the standard you have
so bravely restored to us; and as you have so sternly
avenged the unhappy assassination of the Master of Glenluce,
you shall wear the poor boy's sword on receiving the
commission which his death has rendered vacant."
</p>

<p>
I had no words wherewith to thank the earl, but remember
old Captain Glendonwyn shaking my hand warmly as he
said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Lieutenant Ellis, I congratulate you;" for all ensigns
of fusilier corps were then styled second-lieutenants.
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah!  Master Oliver," added bluff Sergeant Drumbirrel,
as we resumed the march; "when I enlisted you in
Compton Kennel, didn't I say you would one day be a
captain, as your father was before you, and so it has come to
pass?"
</p>

<p>
The Master of Glenluce was rolled in a blanket and hastily
interred at the wayside by a small party left for that purpose
under Corporal Mahony, while the brigade pushed on to
higher ground, for now, as we neared a place called
St. Catharine's, a fire was opened upon us from some redoubts
which were mounted with heavy guns, and manned by a
considerable force, both of the French line and mulattoes.
In consequence of the extent of these works Sir Charles did
not at first deem himself strong enough to attempt an
assault, but took up a position which enabled us, on one hand,
to overlook them, and, on the other, to have an easy
communication with our transports.
</p>

<p>
On this advantageous ground we remained in bivouac for
three days, suffering severely from the alternate heat by
noon, and the chill dew by night.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XLIII.
<br><br>
A HALT.
</h3>

<p>
As a natural sequel to events so exciting, I became
low-spirited for some time, and the tiger-like eyes of the dying
Angolian seemed ever glaring into mine.  Jack Joyce the
marine endeavoured to console, while congratulating me on
promotion, by saying that the man I had killed "was
scarcely a man at all, but only a nigger, and was not to be
considered much more than if he had been a Johnnie
Crapaud&mdash;and all the world valued <i>his</i> life at the worth of a
rope's end, or a piece of old junk."
</p>

<p>
As we had come ostensibly to free the oppressed
colonists alike from rebel troops and insurgent blacks, we
were not allowed to plunder, and were scant enough of
provisions.  I was greatly in want of money; but here an odd
event occurred.  Tom Telfer, when breaking a ration biscuit,
found a guinea baked in the middle of it, and shared
it with me.
</p>

<p>
On the morning of the 12th we were to advance again.  I
was not yet gazetted an officer, and on this morning Tom
and I were cooking our breakfast in a camp-kettle, at a fire
which we had kindled in gipsy fashion, between two stones.
Around, our comrades were busy, some cleaning their arms,
others cooking or packing their kits; and all were singing,
whistling, or engaged in thoughtless frolic, for the beauty of
the scene and of the morning proved charming.  On one
side the blue sea was seen spreading far away, till lost and
blent with the cloudless sky.  In the distance were the
towering Pitons, covered with foliage to their steep
summits, which were lost in a shroud of vapour.  Far down
below us, we saw our fleet at anchor, with canvas loose and
gun-ports open for any emergency.  On our left were a
succession of green ridges that lay between us and Fort
Royal.
</p>

<p>
Close to where Tom and I were stirring our cocoa,
Dr. Splints and his two assistants were operating with true
medical <i>sang-froid</i> on a poor Frenchman, whose leg had
been shattered by a musket-shot, and each time they
probed the wound he shuddered from head to foot, or
uttered a shriek and tore the blue sleeve of his uniform
with his teeth, while his dark eyes flashed with agony and
fear.
</p>

<p>
At last his leg was fairly cut off, and an orderly
bore it away and tossed it into a trench, wherein a few
dead who had been shot in a recent skirmish were lying.
The unfortunate Gaul gazed after it wistfully, and then
closed his eyes in despair, for with it vanished all his hopes
of glory.  He pined and died soon after, and I was one of
those who buried him.
</p>

<p>
After a long and careful reconnoissance, the column was
formed, and we advanced again.
</p>

<p>
The breathless heat of noon was past now.  There was a
delicious coolness in the breeze and a voluptuous tranquillity
in the air.  The leafy solitudes through which we had to
march&mdash;the chastened light of the purple and golden sky,
which shed its reflected hues upon the land and water,
made lighter still the hearts even of the most unthinking.
The broad fan-like branches of the palms were hanging
stilly and solemnly down, and their long blade-formed
leaves were scarcely vibrating.
</p>

<p>
On debouching from a dense thicket, we found that the
foe had abandoned the battery and works at St. Catharine;
so, while we&mdash;the Scots Fusiliers&mdash;advanced double-quick
and took quiet possession of them, Colonel Myers, with the
43rd and five companies of Grenadiers, crossed four ravines
higher up, storming at the bayonet's point all the batteries
which defended them, and opening thus a clear avenue to
Fort Royal, the capital of the island.
</p>

<p>
I cannot close this chapter better than by a quotation
from the despatch of General Sir Charles Grey:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Sir Charles Gordon then occupied the posts of Gentilly
and La Coste.  The good abilities and conduct of Sir
Charles Gordon and of Colonel Myers were eminently manifest
throughout this arduous service, and all the troops of
my division have performed their duty with merit and
bravery.  I have the honour to enclose the casualty lists,
together with Lieutenant-Colonel the Right Honourable
the Earl of Kildonan's recommendation of Sergeant Oliver
Ellis for a commission, he having saved a colour of the
Scots Fusiliers by an act of signal bravery."

<h3>
CHAPTER XLIV.
<br><br>
THE SKIRMISH AT MORNE ROUGE.
</h3>

<p>
We were already within cannon-shot of the outworks
of Fort Royal, and could see the British flag flying
triumphantly above the captured batteries of Mont Mathurine
and the Pigeon Island, the guns of which command all the
bay, when Lieutenant Harry Smith of the Royals arrived
with orders for Sir Charles Gordon to fall back with his
brigade and attack the town of St. Pierre, in conjunction
with the corps of Major-General Dundas.
</p>

<p>
St. Pierre&mdash;the scene of the earlier sorrows of Eulalie
and of her father's murder! my heart beat more quickly,
when I heard the order given, about ten in the morning.
</p>

<p>
"What is the distance from this?" asked the general,
glancing at his watch.
</p>

<p>
"Ten miles," replied Smith.
</p>

<p>
"The ground&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Mountainous and difficult&mdash;woody and intersected by
at least ten streams."
</p>

<p>
"We shall be there by one o'clock, I hope.  Who
commands in St. Pierre?"
</p>

<p>
"The Colonel de Rouvigny."
</p>

<p>
In ten minutes after this, we had folded our blankets,
slung our camp-kettles, quitted the bivouac where we had
spent the night in view of Fort Royal, and, with the 2nd
battalion of Grenadiers, the 65th regiment, and the light
companies of the 33rd and 40th, commenced a retrograde
march, and passing the Caise des Navires on our left,
proceeded over mountains and through dense forests, midway
between the sea and the base of the Pitons du Carbet,
towards the scene of our new operations.
</p>

<p>
The day was unusually hot for the season, even in the
Antilles; and we had hunger and thirst to encounter as
well as heat and toil.  To allay the former&mdash;at the risk of
fever&mdash;we partook of bananas, oranges, and pomegranates
with sangaree and rum, rich cordials and the juices of citron,
lime, and sugar-cane, which we found in plenty in a French
merchant's store.  The fruit brought from gardens in our
vicinity, usually lay in heaps in our bivouacs&mdash;and its hues
were always brilliant, as its flavours were alluring.
</p>

<p>
After we had forded the river du Carbet, above the
little town of St. Jacques, the heat of the noon grew
intolerable.  Our noses, lips, necks, and ears were scorched
by the flaming rays of a sun that seemed to shine vertically
over our heads; there came no breeze from the glassy sea,
and no clouds hovered in the sultry heavens.  The languid
sheep and cattle lolled out their dry tongues as they lay
panting in the shadow of the listless trees; and there was
no sound in the air, but the buzz of huge insects.  The
heat soon exhaled clouds of vapour from the ocean&mdash;but
in their bosom lurked agues, fever, and death.  A volcano
grumbled in the distance, in proportion as land and sea
grew hot; yet manfully we struggled on, laden like
pack-horses with all our arms and camp equipage, to beat up the
quarters of M. de Rouvigny in St. Pierre.
</p>

<p>
We still formed the advanced guard, and on this occasion
I was sent forward with a reconnoitring party, in extended
order, to prevent the main body from falling into any
ambuscade, and the difficulty of forcing one's way in marching
order through woods in these Indian isles, where there were
few roads, is beyond description.  The trees are woven up
together by dense masses of dwarf mangroves and underwood,
and by wild creeping plants of a hundred kinds,
which are so juicy, tough, and tenacious, that they will neither
break nor tear; and under all is a species of grass, the
serrated blades of which cut the hands and face when we
stumbled on them.  These primeval woods and jungles were
everywhere intersected by ravines of basalt and pumice-stone,
where wild tobacco, vines, and gourds were growing,
and where streams from the Pitons brawled towards the sea.
</p>

<p>
The heat we encountered on this day of toil&mdash;heat suffocating
as the breath of a furnace&mdash;as if by very contrast,
brought to memory the cool breezes that fanned the green
fern, the solemn pines, the purple heather, and the golden
corn-fields in our distant Scottish home&mdash;the home of our
hearts, and our forefathers' graves, by loch and lea, by hill and
strath and glen; and then we thought of the hearty old
winter days, and talked of them too, as if by doing so we
would keep ourselves <i>cool</i>&mdash;days when the hazel-nuts and
acorns lay shrivelled in the bare and leafless woods; when
the <i>sough</i> of the winter wind was heard without, while its
icy breath brightened the sea-coal fire within; the snow-clad
hills, the frozen lakes, the bearded waterfall, the red leaves
that whirled before the bitter Norlan blast&mdash;all these I say,
by very contrast, came before our fancy, as we marched on,
perspiring, gasping, and breathless, under the hot sky of the
sultry Indian isles.
</p>

<p>
I often remarked that when on the march in hot weather,
when steam arose from the column, when the water became
putrid in our canteens, when red coats and buff belts become
alike blackened and rotten by perspiration&mdash;unwashed,
choked with dust, and blinded by musquito bites, and while
the sky was glowing like heated brass above us, we spoke
most of home and winter.
</p>

<p>
With the two light companies and the 65th, Colonel
John Campbell, of Blytheswood (commander of the 9th Foot),
an officer of high military reputation, forced a passage through
the dense leafy wilderness of Bois le Buc, the intricacies of
which, might have puzzled its native denizens the monkeys,
towards a place named Montigné; while the general with
the Fusiliers and other forces, proceeded to the heights of
Capot and Calebasse.
</p>

<p>
We had just attained the crest of the latter about
daybreak, when, we heard the sound of heavy firing, and
beheld a body of the enemy, about six hundred in number,
strongly posted, holding our 65th completely in check and
with considerable slaughter.  Now the white smoke started
in huge puffs from the green wood; anon it rolled in line
along the slope of the hill; now bayonets were seen to flash
in the sunlight, and then we saw the white colours of the
65th, waving as the red coats were mingled in wild <i>mêlée</i>
with the blue of the Republicans.
</p>

<p>
Our company of the Scots Fusiliers, with sixty-three
light infantry men, under Captain Ramsey, of the Queen's
Regiment, were detached double-quick through the jungle of
Bois le Buc to attack the French in flank and support the
65th.  Gaining the crest of an eminence named Poste-au-Pin,
at four hundred yards we opened a fire, which enfiled their
whole line; and closing up with all speed, effectually silenced
the fire of the French.  They then fell back under the
orders of a tall officer, who was mounted on a black horse,
and who particularly distinguished himself, for he led the
charge of bayonets that ended in a hand-to-hand encounter
with Colonel Campbell, whom he slew by a pistol-shot, after
that powerful Highlander had hewn down two sides by his
sword.  Over ground strewn with the bloody <i>débris</i> of this
conflict, we drove the enemy back until we gained a position
on the ridge of Morne Rouge, while they took shelter under
the guns of a small redoubt, and maintained from thence a
desultory skirmish with our men, who lurked among the
underwood, and picked them off on every available opportunity.
</p>

<p>
Around the tall and stately Laird of Blytheswood, the
dead lay thick upon the green savannah, for the brave 65th
fought desperately to rescue his body.  Many of the slain
retained a portion of the attitude in which death struck
them.  I saw a 65th man, who had been shot while in the
act of bayoneting a Frenchman.  The former lay with his
musket still at the charge; his dark brows knit&mdash;his strong
teeth clenched as if by lock-jaw&mdash;the glazed eyes yet fierce
and stern.  The latter, who had died of bleeding, with the
bayonet in his body, had his clasped hands and sightless
eyes uplifted to heaven, for he had died in the act of prayer.
Beside them crouched a dog, which had belonged to one or
other, and seemed waiting for his master to rise and whistle
him on as usual.
</p>

<p>
On searching a dead Frenchman's havresack for food, I
found, to my disgust, a female finger, whereon were three
valuable rings, which he had been unable to remove in time,
and so had hewed the member off&mdash;for such acts were quite
common in the French army in those days of anarchy and
cruelty.
</p>

<p>
With a dozen of my own company, I succeeded in luring
the mounted officer who slew poor Blytheswood, with a few
of his men, into a plantation of sugar-canes beyond range of
the redoubt guns.  We lay flat on our faces, and only
started up at times to have a shot at each other, when our
black bearskin caps on one side, or the huge misshapen
cocked hats and red plumes on the other, became visible
above the cane-tops.  Here Tom Telfer shot the officer's
horse, and before he could free himself from the stirrups,
with a shout of exultation we were upon him.  As
we collared, disarmed, and dragged him up, what were
my emotions on finding myself face to face with my
quondam padre, the Colonel de Rouvigny, commandant at
St. Pierre!
</p>

<p><a id="chap45"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XLV
<br><br>
THE BLANK FUSILADE.
</h3>

<p>
With Rouvigny we captured a few of his men, and an
officer (a very handsome young man), who gave up his
sword to me with the most perfect <i>sang froid</i>.  Before I
could address our chief prisoner, who never deigned or
affected to recognize me, the brigadier came galloping up and
on discovering the rank and importance of Rouvigny,
desired me to conduct him under escort, to a ruined sugar-mill,
which stood about a mile in our rear, and was beyond
range of the cannon in the redoubt.  As we moved off, the
young officer began to sing gaily,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Halte la! halte la!<br>
  La Garde Royale est la!<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Surprised to hear the refrain of this old song in the mouth
of one I deemed a republican officer, I turned to address
him, and asked how, at such a time, he was so light of
heart.  On this, he told me that he was one of those whose
sympathies were with the recently extinguished monarchy
of France&mdash;that he was sick of serving among republican
soldiers, who daily put his life in jeopardy&mdash;and
that he rejoiced in being taken prisoner by the allies of
Louis XVII.
</p>

<p>
"Your name, monsieur?" said I.
</p>

<p>
"Dutriel&mdash;sous-lieutenant of the 37th, late the regiment
of M. le Maréchal de Turenne; and now a ragged battalion
in the service of the republic&mdash;<i>sacredie</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"The name you have given sounds familiar to me."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis very probable, <i>mon camerade</i>, for my father was
M. le Chevalier Naudau Dutriel, governor of Guadaloupe
and La Grande Terre, for his most Christian majesty; but
was unfortunately defeated and taken prisoner by the
British under General Harrington in the old war, before
we became republicans, atheists, philosophers, and the devil
only knows what more."
</p>

<p>
"Such sentiments will place your head in peril at home."
</p>

<p>
"Bah!" said he; "I have no intention of going home.
I am a soldier; my head can take care of itself; but it
is my heart and purse that are usually in most danger;
for the first is sure to fall a prey to any pretty wench,
and the last is ever shared with a comrade while a shot
remains in it."
</p>

<p>
There is among men who serve or have served in the
army, a community of sentiment&mdash;a species of freemasonry
peculiar to them alone.  The French so happy at all times
in their terms, style it <i>cameraderie</i>; thus the chevalier and
I became as old friends in ten minutes.
</p>

<p>
"Sir, as a gentleman, you are at liberty to retain your
sword," said I, presenting him with his weapon, which he
received with courtly grace.
</p>

<p>
"And I?" demanded Rouvigny fiercely.
</p>

<p>
I placed his sabre under my foot, and snapped the blade
in pieces.
</p>

<p>
"Tonnerre de Ciel!" he cried in a voice of fury.
</p>

<p>
"As for you, sir," said I, "you shall hear from me
presently."
</p>

<p>
It was clear there was no "freemasonry" between
M. Rouvigny and his captor.
</p>

<p>
"Vive le Chevalier Dutriel!" cried a French soldier.
</p>

<p>
"A bas l'aristocrat&mdash;vive le bonnet rouge!" growled
another, of the new régime.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, pray keep your temper, my dear M. de Rouvigny,"
said Dutriel; "you have, on many a day sorely tried mine&mdash;I,
a gentleman of old France&mdash;you a child of rapine&mdash;a
mushroom, fostered in the pestilent mire of the republic.
A colonel&mdash;<i>sacredie!</i>&mdash;who found his epaulettes on a barricade
or at the foot of a gallows.  He is your prisoner, <i>mon
camerade</i>&mdash;make much of him, for he is a very distinguished
man.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Halte la! halte la!<br>
  La Garde Royale est la!"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
By this time we had reached the ruined sugar-mill, from
the quiet neighbourhood of which our arrival scared away
some poor negro women who were weaving pretty baskets
of canes and bamboo, and in the lower apartment of which
I confined Rouvigny, apart from the other prisoners, as I
had a project to put in execution against him.
</p>

<p>
Circumstanced as he was, I could not challenge him to a
duel, and, as I had not yet my epaulettes, the chances were,
that natheless his republicanism and boasted spirit of
égalité, he would have declined to meet me; yet I was
resolved that he should taste all the bitterness of
degradation, and all the agony of death, without its actual
infliction.
</p>

<p>
After posting sentinels round the mill, and making other
dispositions to preclude an escape, I entered the wretched
apartment,&mdash;if it could be named so,&mdash;a mere vault or
storehouse, where Rouvigny was confined.  It was littered
by heaps of rotting sugar-canes, old casks, and broken
packing-boxes.  On one of these I found him seated, with
a sullen air; his blue uniform coat was open, and his
tri-coloured sash was thrown aside for coolness, as the
atmosphere was still close and sultry.
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur de Rouvigny will soon have reason for the
exertion of all his philosophy," said I.
</p>

<p>
"An easy matter for him at all times," he replied, with a
gesture of scorn.
</p>

<p>
"We shall see."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Bon!</i>" said he, with a grimace.
</p>

<p>
"Think what you are, sir, and how situated?"
</p>

<p>
"I am one of the new French school of philanthropists."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed!"
</p>

<p>
"I am an exterminator of aristocrats.  Dolt that I was
to spare that jesting dog, Dutriel."
</p>

<p>
"Then it was in this spirit that you murdered the Sieur
de Mazancy at the head of his regiment."
</p>

<p>
"Excuse me, <i>mon soldat</i>, but you are very ignorant.  He
died by the same decree of the National Assembly which
doomed all his class to the lantern, the sabre, or the
guillotine."
</p>

<p>
"And his daughter&mdash;&mdash;" my voice trembled.
</p>

<p>
He ground his teeth,&mdash;then gave a sardonic smile, and
replied,&mdash;"I converted Eulalie into the wife of a plain but
honest French citizen.  Into <i>what</i> have you converted her?"
</p>

<p>
"Assassin and spy!" I exclaimed, with fury.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ouf</i>&mdash;you are anything but polite."
</p>

<p>
"Poltroon! to murder a woman in the night," I continued,
with growing bitterness.
</p>

<p>
He uttered a shout of laughter, and rasped his spurred
heels to and fro against the cask on which he was seated.
Then, with provoking <i>nonchalance</i>, he proceeded to light a
cigar.
</p>

<p>
"Do you smoke?" said he;&mdash;"oh, you don't&mdash;well, you
will permit me; these are very choice Havannahs.  You
have no objections?&mdash;<i>bon!</i> such an obliging fellow you are!
It seems we come to Martinique to talk as well as to fight."
</p>

<p>
"We have come to repress and punish outrage&mdash;to save
Frenchmen from Frenchmen and savages," said I.
</p>

<p>
"True; we have been apt to consider prosperity treason
to the people.  Wealth, an enemy to the purity of a republic,
and in this spirit have ventured to hang and even to
boil in their own coppers a few very aristocratic planters in
their exceedingly democratic sugar-mills&mdash;but what then?
Do have a cigar, <i>mon ami</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Bantering villain! we have had enough of this.  I would
speak of Eulalie de Rouvigny, whom you have destroyed
like a wretch as you are."
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur permits himself to be impertinent.  Am I, a
French citizen&mdash;a husband, to be accountable in this little
matter to you?"
</p>

<p>
"You are accountable to humanity."
</p>

<p>
"Bah! we don't value that much in these days when
charges of bayonets are common things."
</p>

<p>
"It would seem so."
</p>

<p>
"Well, monsieur?"
</p>

<p>
"What inspired a deed so foul, so cruel, as the abduction
and the death of Eulalie?"
</p>

<p>
"Honour."
</p>

<p>
"Honour!" I reiterated contemptuously.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, don't interrupt me, and don't repeat my words if
you please," he replied, grinding his sharp teeth; "honour
and retributive justice were my guides and my incentives.
The honour of a husband whom she had deserted&mdash;the vengeance
of France, whom she had betrayed.  Love and revenge
are two fingers of the same hand."
</p>

<p>
"By Heaven, Colonel Rouvigny, she was a thousand times
better and purer than the mother who, for her sins,
encumbered the earth with such a being as you."
</p>

<p>
"Very probably," he continued in his bantering manner,
while whiffing his cigar, and while the savage gleam in his
eyes belied the affected suavity of his manner; "but my
most choleric friend, have the kindness to remember that
she was mine by marriage&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"A marriage!&mdash;a foul snare, which she abhorred,
and by which her happiness was withered, her future
blasted."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Sang Dieu!</i> she told you all this?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said I, with a cutting smile.
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;did this entitle her to betray France?"
</p>

<p>
"She was, like her father, true to France and France's
ancient line of kings."
</p>

<p>
"Tyrants and gluttons, with whom the men of the new
world had done."
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur, you are here at my mercy&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"At yours&mdash;<i>tonnerre de Ciel!</i> well?"
</p>

<p>
"I am about to kill you by a platoon of musketry."
</p>

<p>
"Would you dare to murder me&mdash;a prisoner of war&mdash;in
cold blood?" said he, starting.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;as a spy and assassin; you will therefore have the
Christian spirit, I trust, to make your peace with Heaven,
and to reveal to me the fate of your wife&mdash;of Eulalie de
Mazancy&mdash;on board that vessel, the schooner <i>Les Droits ds
l'Homme</i>, off Barbadoes."
</p>

<p>
As I said this with considerable solemnity, he changed
colour.  Rage, malignant hatred, and fear, were all very
plainly expressed in his pale and marble-like visage.  His
stern brow grew frightfully contracted, and glistening beads
of perspiration seemed to start from the old sabre-cut that
had traversed it.  He knocked the ashes carefully from his
cigar, and then tossing it away, spat full at me, in all the
fury of impotent wrath, and uttered the single word&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"<i>Never!</i>"
</p>

<p>
It seemed to come from the depths of his chest.  He
covered his face with his hands; then starting up erect, he
cried in a voice of stern authority,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Lead on&mdash;I am ready."
</p>

<p>
"Follow me," I replied.
</p>

<p>
He hesitated, so I added, full of rage that I had failed to
learn the secret of her fate,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Follow, if you would avoid the disgrace of being
dragged."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Tête Dieu!</i>" he exclaimed, and smote his forehead.
</p>

<p>
We stepped from the ruined sugar-mill into the full blaze
of the sunshine, and on the green luxuriant grass that grew
under the foliage of a citron-grove.  All Nature seemed so
sunny and beautiful, that I felt a momentary compunction
on witnessing the farewell glance he cast around him&mdash;a
farewell to light, to life, and to the future; for he could not
have a shadow of hope, on seeing eight of my comrades in
line resting on their muskets, and close by Tom Telfer,
standing shovel in hand beside a newly-made grave&mdash;a hole
of ominous aspect, six feet by two, which he had just dug
by my directions.  While he tied a handkerchief over the
eyes of Rouvigny, I ordered the party to load with <i>blank</i>
cartridge, and his frame shuddered when he heard the
ramrods go home with a dull sound on the powder; but
knowing the trick we were to play, they all loaded carefully.
</p>

<p>
Our prisoner knelt down near the pretended grave, and
folded his arms without a word of prayer or entreaty;
while the Chevalier Dutriel lighted a fresh cigar, and looked
on with perfect indifference, for he had an undisguised
hatred for his newly-made republican colonel, and had seen
too many of his friends perish thus in the citadel of
St. Pierre, to be startled by such an episode.  He deemed it
merely an act of retribution.
</p>

<p>
In a low voice I offered Rouvigny his life for the secret
of Eulalie's fate; but received no reply.
</p>

<p>
"Fire!" I exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
At twenty paces eight muskets were discharged full at
his head.  When the smoke cleared away, to my astonishment
and alarm we saw him lying flat on his face, with the
ammunition-paper whirling about him.  Dreading some
terrible mistake, we all rushed forward and lifted him.  Not
a ball had been fired; he was without even a scratch, but
hung in our grasp&mdash;<i>stone dead</i>!
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap46"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XLVI.
<br><br>
CAPTURE OF ST. PIERRE.
</h3>

<p>
This unforeseen catastrophe filled us with pity for him,
and caused me some alarm for myself in having thus trifled
with the life of a prisoner of war.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Morbleu!</i>" said the Chevalier Dutriel; "you meant to
let him taste the bitterness of death; but I fear he has
found your potion a little too bitter.  Do not waste
compassion on him, <i>mon ami</i>; <i>he</i> felt none when he hewed off
the heads of St. Julian and De la Bourdonaye, two of the
most brilliant officers in the Régiment de Turenne.  He had
no respect for the white hairs of the Sieur de Mazancy when
he tore the cross of St. Louis from his breast, and shot him
in cold blood; no compassion for the youth or beauty of his
daughter.  Bah! away with this six feet of carrion, and
cover it up."
</p>

<p>
These words somewhat restored me, and, on ascertaining
that Rouvigny was really dead, we rolled him up in an old
mat that lay in the mill, while I ordered some negroes who
were loitering near to dig a deeper tomb for him.
</p>

<p>
Perceiving that after digging a little way they relinquished
that grave and proceeded to dig another, I inquired the
reason, on which an old Angola negro, whose white woolly
head seemed to have been snowed on, pointed to a large
stone in the hole, and said, in broken English,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"White man no wish to be bury there."
</p>

<p>
"Why so, Quashi?" (All negroes are named Quashi.)
</p>

<p>
"Big stone there, massa&mdash;dam big stone&mdash;dig other
place."
</p>

<p>
Then another old <i>Obeah</i> negro&mdash;a species of physician or
conjuror, of whom the others stood much in awe&mdash;informed
us in bad French that whenever a stone was found in a grave
the place was deemed unpropitious.  In short, they dug so
many holes, and found so many unlucky stones, that the
whole place was likely to be uprooted without the unfortunate
Rouvigny finding a resting-place, till two of the
Fusiliers threw off their belts and jackets, assumed the
shovel, and acted the part of sextons.
</p>

<p>
By the time this melancholy episode was over, and we had
reached the regiment, the enemy had abandoned their
redoubt at Le Morne Rouge, leaving two fieldpieces in
possession of the 65th Regiment, with many military stores.
</p>

<p>
I feared much that I was in a scrape on reporting that the
French colonel had died in our hands; but no inquiry
followed, for a life more or less mattered little, when we had
such work in hand as the conquest of the French Antilles.
</p>

<p>
I remember the Chevalier Dutriel showing to me the place
where, in the attack that was made on Martinique by General
Hopson in 1759, two hundred of the 42nd Highlanders&mdash;"Montagnards,"
as he said,&mdash;"du seconde bataillon du Régiment
de milord Jean Murray, qu'on avait amené d'Ecosse,
sous le convoi du <i>Ludlow Castle</i>," had flung their muskets
aside in the old Celtic fashion, drawn their swords, and
carried all before them.  He showed us, also, where their dead,
among whom was a Lieutenant Leslie, were buried, and before
we left Martinique the Scots Fusiliers enclosed the place by
a low wall, and planted it with laurel-trees; for even here,
under the shadow of the Pitons, as under the shadow of the
Pyramids, has the war-pipe of Albyn sent up its shrill
"invitation to the wolf and the raven."
</p>

<p>
The Chevalier Dutriel afterwards entered the regiment of
Sir Louis de Watteville, and fell in battle under the banner
of Wellington in Spain, in one of the first encounters after
Corunna.
</p>

<p>
We now resumed our advance upon St. Pierre, after
interring the dead who lay with Campbell of Blytheswood at
Morne Rouge.
</p>

<p>
"We have had warm work, to-day, gentlemen," said the
young earl thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Kildonan," replied Sir Charles Gordon, "and this
trench filled with dead is a terrible proof of it.  Be quick,
my lads, and cover the poor fellows up.  Farewell to you!"
continued the old general, waving his cocked hat to the dead,
who lay piled over each other in ghastly and bloody rows;
"may God receive you, boys!  What is your turn to-day,
may be <i>ours</i> to-morrow, for we know not what an hour may
bring forth."
</p>

<p>
This was their only funeral oration; and leaving a party
under Corporal Telfer to cover them up, our bands began
playing as we pushed once more westward along the
mountain road.  On our right towered the wooded Pitons; on
our left was the silent shore, its rocks and verdure seeming
to palpitate under the rays of the hot sun, while the boundless
sea rolled its waves in hundreds of thousands upon the
whitened beach&mdash;rising, falling, racing, and foaming on.
</p>

<p>
By rosy daybreak next morning, on descending a green
hill, over which the main road from Fort Royal passes, we
saw the beautiful bay and clean pretty town of St. Pierre,
with its two slender spires, its irregular houses in the form
of a semicircle, extending to Bourg St. Pierre, and its castle
on a rocky promontory with the tricolor of France flying
from its summit.  A white flag was displayed upon the
Ursuline convent, to protect it from shot and shell; a
second was waving on the hospital, built for the poor and
infirm in the reign of Louis XIV., and a third was on
the Jesuits' Cloister, a fine edifice formed of marble and
freestone.
</p>

<p>
The old citadel, which was built by the Sieur d'Enambuc,
in 1666, had two great towers, each having four portholes.
It had also several parapets and battlements of stone, which
had been further strengthened by Rouvigny; thus its general
aspect suggested ideas of a sanguinary escalade.  This
fortress was the ancient stronghold of the governor-general
of the Antilles, and of the French Royal West-India
Company, whose charter from Louis XIV. was dated in 1665.
</p>

<p>
Around, were broad and fertile savannahs under beautiful
cultivation, where the sprouting rice and maize, sugar and
Indian corn, waved in the morning breeze, like the pale
green ripples of a shallow sea.
</p>

<p>
As we advanced upon the town, two of our men were slain
under somewhat peculiar circumstances.
</p>

<p>
One&mdash;an old soldier, who had escaped without a wound
the dangers of eight engagements&mdash;found an old rusty bomb
lying by the wayside, and chancing heedlessly to poke the
fuse-hole with his bayonet, it exploded, and blew his head
and right arm completely off.  The fate of the other soldier
was still more remarkable, and afforded those who were
near him, some cause for reflection.
</p>

<p>
He was one of the light infantry battalion, and had
frequently misconducted himself.  He was uttering fearful
oaths in the ranks as we advanced, until he received a
personal rebuke from the General, who said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Silence, sirrah! a forlorn hope will soon be required, and
I expect that you will be among the first to volunteer, to
make amends for your present misconduct."
</p>

<p>
"A forlorn hope; and who the devil is to lead us?"
asked the soldier, insolently.
</p>

<p>
"I shall," replied the general, haughtily; "do you
imagine, fellow, that I will order my men on any duty that
I personally shrink from?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll not volunteer, general; I am not such a d&mdash;&mdash;d
fool!  I set some value on my life; and being doubtful
about another world, wish to remain in this one as long as I
can."
</p>

<p>
"Silence, I command you; or you shall be sent as a
prisoner to the rear!"
</p>

<p>
On this, the man, as if possessed by the devil, broke out
into a torrent of imprecations, and concluded by wishing
"that God might strike him dead" for his folly in becoming
a soldier.
</p>

<p>
The fatal words had scarcely left his lips, when a
musket-ball that came from where we knew not&mdash;for we were
marching through an open and level savannah&mdash;struck him
full on the forehead, and he fell flat on his face a dead
man!
</p>

<p>
We marched on, some in silence, but many more engaged
in surmises; for this startling event, which seemed like the
judgment of Heaven upon a blasphemer, produced a
painful sensation, even among the heedless fellows who
witnessed it.
</p>

<p>
At last we halted, and taking up a position within two
miles of St. Pierre, piled arms in close column of regiments.
We now suffered greatly from thirst; but on discovering a
quantity of wine stored up in the lower rooms of an abandoned
villa, I filled my canteen, and hastened to inform the
good old captain of my company; but just at the moment
the Earl of Kildonan rode up to him.
</p>

<p>
"What is the hour, Glendonwyn?" he asked.  "I had
my watch broken by a spent ball yesterday."
</p>

<p>
From the deep fob of his regimental breeches, the
white-haired captain pulled forth a huge antique metal watch,
which was known in the corps as "the chronometer," and
replied with a smirk,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Exactly grog time of day, my lord."
</p>

<p>
"Grog time&mdash;twelve o'clock; ah, but we can have no
grog till we get it out of the French stores; and I
understand there are some thousand casks of Cognac and Leeward
Island rum in St. Pierre.  Only think of that! but to tap
them&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"We have only to cross a counterscarp&mdash;storm a glacis
bristling with bayonets, and spike a few guns; so many a
pretty fellow may lose the number of his mess before
the grog is served out," replied the veteran, replacing his
watch.
</p>

<p>
I now approached and offered the contents of my
newly-discovered wine-store.
</p>

<p>
"Egad, this fellow Ellis is invaluable!" said Glendonwyn;
"lead on,&mdash;no tricks, though, I hope,&mdash;for I remember when
your father and I were at the siege of Belleisle, we dined off
the leg of a young jackass, which was sold to us by a rascally
sutler as delicate veal, and we never discovered the truth
for many a day after."
</p>

<p>
Haystone, and several other officers, accompanied us to
the villa, which, in many respects, reminded me of the
residence of Eulalie; but its furniture had been destroyed
by the revolted blacks of Bellegarde, and the walls were
chalked over with caricatures of the late Governor Mazancy,
and of the king, to whom he had been so faithful.  With
these were many obscene, rebellious, and political legends,
such as, "Down with the Red Ribbon, with God, and the
Cross!  Live the sovereign people!"  There was a
representation of Louis XVI. hanging on a gallows; under this
was inscribed,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Citizen Louis, dancing a court cotillion."
</p>

<p>
Another represented the unfortunate king, headless, with
the legend,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Louis cranchant (<i>i.e.</i> spitting) dans le sac," a brutal
phrase, as his head was supposed to be in the bag attached
to the platform of the guillotine.  Several runlets of wine
were trundled into this apartment and broached.  We
found also plenty of yams and plaintains in a pantry,
together with squash and Guinea fowls, ready cooked; thus
showing that the last occupants had fled at our approach.
</p>

<p>
"Light dinner sherry," said one, draining his canteen
nearly at a draught.
</p>

<p>
"Often denominated 'curious,'" added Bruce, with a
wink.
</p>

<p>
"And very curious, you may find it to-morrow morning,"
said Haystone.
</p>

<p>
"A little brandy may keep it right," said the earl; and
holding aloft his canteen, exclaimed, "To the health of the
first men who get into St. Pierre!"
</p>

<p>
"Here's some port of the finest quality," said one of our
captains, pulling a spiggot from a cask.
</p>

<p>
"Hark to Kinlochmoidart; he talks like an auctioneer.
But, my dear fellow, I don't care a fig about the quality."
</p>

<p>
"What then, Glendonwyn?"
</p>

<p>
"The quantity&mdash;the quantity is the thing one studies
most on the line of march."
</p>

<p>
"May we all be as merry this time to-morrow," said
Kinlochmoidart thoughtfully, as he had a presentiment that
he would fall in the Antilles.
</p>

<p>
"I am about to make my will," rejoined Haystone,
heedlessly; "and shall solemnly bequeath&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What?"
</p>

<p>
"My castles in the air&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"To whom?"
</p>

<p>
"My posterity&mdash;my heirs and assignees."
</p>

<p>
"Don't talk so foolishly," said Kinlochmoidart.  "When
we have such desperate work before us, Rowland, one ought
to reflect&mdash;to think."
</p>

<p>
"What the devil is the use of reflection?" asked the
thoughtless subaltern; "it would only bother me, and be of
no use to the regiment or the world at large.  No, no, my
dear sir&mdash;time enough to think when I get old, and cut the
service.  Meantime, let us be jolly.  A toast, gentlemen," he
added, getting astride one of the wine-casks, and holding up
his canteen; "Here's to the Lands of Cakes, of Leeks, of
Puddings, and Potatoes&mdash;hip, hip, hurrah!"
</p>

<p>
We were fast getting merry, when Smith of the Royals
galloped up to one of the open windows, and said:
</p>

<p>
"The brigade is at once to close to the front, and the
Scots Fusiliers, as the senior regiment, are to have the
honour of furnishing the forlorn hope."
</p>

<p>
"Egad, I thought it would soon come to this," exclaimed
the earl.  "Glendonwyn, order the men to stand to their
arms.  How many are wanted?"
</p>

<p>
"One hundred rank and file," replied the aide, casting a
glance of affection at our wine-casks.
</p>

<p>
"State to the corps what the general requires, Glendonwyn,
and bring the whole forlorn hope here.  Smith,
meanwhile help yourself, while time and wine last."
</p>

<p>
"Egad, you are in luck here!" said the aide-de-camp.
</p>

<p>
Captain Glendonwyn hurried to where our battalion were
bivouacked near a thicket; but in a few minutes he returned
solus.
</p>

<p>
"Alone!" we all exclaimed, starting up; "what is the
meaning of this?"
</p>

<p>
"I formed the battalion in column," replied Glendonwyn,
whose cheek was flushing, while his eyes sparkled with
emotion; "and in obedience to your lordship's order,
required a hundred volunteers for a storming-party.  The
words had scarcely left my lips, when, as one man, the
<i>whole regiment</i> stepped to the front, and claimed the
dangerous pre-eminence."*
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* A similar incident occurred with the 45th at Ciudad Rodrigo.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"My Fusiliers&mdash;bravo, my Fusiliers!" exclaimed the
earl, with flashing eyes; "who would not be proud of
leading such men as these?"
</p>

<p>
"Some of our old fellows, like Sergeant Drumbirrel and
Corporal Mahony, who had been with us at Belle-Isle and
in West Florida, demanded the forlorn hope as their right;
and so, to end the matter, I ordered number one company
to prepare for the assault."
</p>

<p>
"Mine!" said Macdonald.  "Glendonwyn, I thank you.
Smith, please to let the general know we shall be ready
whenever he chooses."
</p>

<p>
This officer was the grandson of the loyal and gallant
Lieutenant-Colonel Donald Macdonald, of Kinlochmoidart,
who was aide-de-camp to Prince Charles Stuart, and was one
of the many who perished in the Government shambles at
the Castle of Carlisle in 1746.  He inherited all the courage
and spirit of his race, and prepared at once for the task in
hand&mdash;to escalade the citadel of St. Pierre, which was
destitute of ditches, but had a very troublesome advanced work
of palisades and loopholes, with a cavalier of ten
24-pounders.
</p>

<p>
When night closed in, his company cast aside their knapsacks,
carefully inspected their arms and ammunition, and
fixed fresh flints, while ladders that would admit three or
four men abreast, were hastily prepared from the flooring
and rafters of a house which we dismantled for the purpose.
</p>

<p>
As the brigade advanced for the purpose of assaulting the
citadel in the dark&mdash;or rather, when a full round moon was
shooting its wild and wierdlike gleams of light through the
rents in a mass of black clouds&mdash;a tumultuary hurrah, and
sounds of drums and firing, were heard within the town.
All this seemed perfectly unaccountable; but Lieutenant
Haystone, who had daringly crept forward to reconnoitre,
returned with the pleasing intelligence that, according to
an originally concerted plan, of which we were ignorant,
Colonel Symes and Major Maitland of the 58th had landed
on the north of the town with a strong detachment of their
regiment, while five companies of Grenadiers and five of
light infantry under Colonel Myers had assailed it on
another point, and thus saved us all further trouble.
</p>

<p>
When day dawned, the union-jack was floating quietly
over the castle of St. Pierre.

CHAPTER XLVII.
<br><br>
THE CONVENT OF ST. URSULE.
</h3>

<p>
Two other episodes will close my adventures in the Isle
of Martinique.
</p>

<p>
I need not detail to the reader the investment of Fort
Bourbon, where General Rochambeau, commander of the
French West-India Islands, made a desperate resistance, at
the head of twelve hundred men of a revolted regiment of
the French line&mdash;the old 37th, or Marshal Turenne's corps;
and how, at the point of the bayonet, we hurled Bellegarde
and Pelocque, the leaders of the blacks and mulattoes, with
all their dingy warriors, from the heights of La Sourrière,
with the loss of all their cannon and plunder; or how we
toiled day and night&mdash;officers and soldiers working side by
Bide&mdash;to make a new road over the mountains, and to drag
up heavy guns and mortars, till, finding the futility of
further resistance, Rochambeau capitulated, delivering over
the fortress, with five stand of colours, and all the cannon and
arms.  When Rochambeau came forth, he was clad in the
new uniform of a general of the Republic&mdash;to wit, a blue
coat, richly embroidered with gold; a white satin waistcoat
and blue pantaloons, also laced with gold; a cocked hat and
nodding tricoloured plume.  The hilt and scabbard of his
sabre were studded with precious stones.
</p>

<p>
From plainness, the sovereign people were hurrying
into the extreme of military frippery.
</p>

<p>
With the shattered remnant of his forces, consisting of
the 37th and the gunners of the marine corps, he embarked
on board the fleet of Admiral Jervis for conveyance to
England, as prisoner of war.
</p>

<p>
The two barriers of Fort Bourbon were delivered over
with all due formality, and I had the honour first to do duty
as an officer by commanding a Fusilier guard at the eastern
gate on this eventful day.  Then came the preparation of
those lists, which, as poor Jack Rolster our adjutant said,
"were to carry grief to many a heart, and perhaps poverty
to many a home;" yet, our losses in killed, wounded, and
missing (barely three hundred) were trifling, when we
considered the value of the territory we had added to the
British crown.  The casualties in our ranks were rapidly
replaced by volunteers from the Scottish Lowland Fencible
corps which were in process of reduction at this time.
</p>

<p>
In the store-houses of Fort Bourbon, we found great
quantities of rice, maize, potatoes, figs, melons, and bananas.
These, with pigs, turkeys, and wood-pigeons, kept us in fresh
provisions for a long time.
</p>

<p>
The casualties of a soldier's life in these wild and perilous
times, brought me through many a strange adventure and
mischance; but few of these have impressed me more vividly
than those connected with our campaign in Martinique.
</p>

<p>
At Fort Bourbon, Captain Glendonwyn discovered in the
quarters of the late Colonel de Rouvigny, a vast quantity
of plunder, among which were the gold and silver altar
vessels, the jewels, vestments, books, reliques, and pictures
belonging to the Ursuline convent at St. Pierre.  These the
general ordered to be packed up, and to be delivered to the
superior; and on this peaceful duty, with all the paraphernalia
of St. Ursule piled in a cart, driven by two half-naked
negroes, and guarded by twenty Fusiliers, I marched
by the main road to St. Pierre, passing on the way all the
ruined and dismantled batteries we had so lately taken
from the French, and over which the young grass and weeds
were already sprouting.
</p>

<p>
After a twenty-one miles' march, we re-entered St. Pierre
about nightfall.  All was quiet then, as our troops occupied
both the town and citadel.  Even the revolted blacks&mdash;our
most dreadful enemies&mdash;dared not to molest a red-coat now,
unless they caught him straggling and alone.
</p>

<p>
It is impossible to depict the state of danger to which
the decree of the French National Assembly by abolishing
all distinctions of colour in their Colonies, reduced
their wretched planters in the Antilles.  The murders
and devastations consequent on this decree are incalculable.
In San Domingo alone one hundred and thirty-five
thousand furious blacks were in arms, destroying all whose
colour was fairer than their own; ten thousand of these
marauders were killed, and twenty-four thousand were
dispersed, but not before they had destroyed five hundred and
forty-seven coffee and sugar plantations, and tortured to
death in cold blood two hundred and fourteen white men
and women.  A <i>white infant</i>, impaled on a spear, was their
banner and symbol!
</p>

<p>
Martinique, St. Bartholomew, Marigalante, and Los
Santos, were all similarly convulsed.
</p>

<p>
I remember the terrible devastation of a village which
the blacks of Bellegarde and Pelocque had ravaged.  The
little church of St. Martin had been shamefully desecrated;
the images had been torn from their niches, the
ornaments defaced, and bibles and missals were rent to
shreds.  In the houses, the skeletons, still with sufficient
fragments of clothing about them to indicate their sexes,
lay in veritable heaps, some with their sightless sockets
turned still to heaven imploring the mercy or succour which
never came.  In the streets and alleys lay scattered bones,
as if wild animals had gnawed and strewed them about.
In the fleshless hand of a woman lay a blood-stained bible,
which was open at the words, "It is better to be in the
house of mourning than of feasting."  A leaf was turned
down at the passage which was thus impressed upon my
memory.  But to resume.
</p>

<p>
I proceeded direct to the Ursuline convent, which stands
on the bank of a little stream.
</p>

<p>
As the French religieux were all royalists and in the
interest of Britain, I soon obtained an audience of the
Superior in the reception-room or parlour of the convent&mdash;an
apartment having a tiled floor, and broad sunshades over
its windows, the open Venetian blinds of which overlooked
a beautiful garden, where the classic myrtle, the Provence
rose, the geranium, and the violet, with all the flowers of
Europe and the Indian isles were blooming.  In the twilight
of the evening, and in the sombre apartment (its walls were
painted with a russet-green tint which rendered the hue of
everything deeper still), I remember being struck by the
grace and bearing of the lady, to whom I readily introduced
myself, not without a strange undefinable emotion of interest,
as this was the first occasion on which I had ever stood
within the walls of a convent, or made the acquaintance of
a recluse, save through the medium of a circulating library.
The grace of this woman's form, neither her black serge
robe, nor her square white hood, which fell in sepulchral
folds over her brow and under her chin, could conceal.  She
revealed only the lower part of her face, and, on seeing me,
paused and seemed rather agitated.
</p>

<p>
"Madame," said I, "you must excuse me, if at this
hour I intrude upon one, who with her companions, must
have suffered so many terrors of late; but I come hither
by the orders of Sir Charles Grey, the commander-in-chief
of the British troops, to restore some valuable
property&mdash;the plunder of your convent&mdash;which we discovered
in Fort Bourbon, after its capitulation by General
Rochambeau."
</p>

<p>
She now raised her head, and lifting her white hood,
gazed on me sorrowfully, sweetly, and with features so pale,
that in her sombre dress she seemed like one returned from
the grave.  Suddenly, a pang shot through my heart, and an
exclamation escaped me.
</p>

<p>
"Eulalie!"
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur Oliver&mdash;I thought you would know me at last,"
said she, with a sad smile.
</p>

<p>
"Eulalie&mdash;here, alive, and in this strange dress!"
</p>

<p>
I held out my arms, but she shrank back.
</p>

<p>
"You see how wayward is my fate," said she.
</p>

<p>
"You are now&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"A nun."  She shook her head, and let her arms droop
by her side.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Eulalie&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Repining is futile&mdash;I have taken the irrevocable vows
for life."
</p>

<p>
"For life!  you know not the suspense&mdash;I may well call it
torture&mdash;I endured, my dear friend&mdash;after discovering your
abduction from Barbadoes; visions of cruelty and death
were ever before me."
</p>

<p>
"I suffered much cruelty, but not death.  Rouvigny
relented&mdash;even <i>he</i> could relent.  He brought me here, and I
embraced a new life, as an escape from that to which he had
condemned me."
</p>

<p>
"But was not this irregular&mdash;without a divorce? and
consent&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Of the Pope you would say?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"It is irregular; but in the total confusion of all our
ecclesiastical affairs, here and in Italy, the Bishop of
Martinique, though deposed by the Republicans, permitted it, as
the best mode of separating us for ever, and perhaps of
protecting me."
</p>

<p>
"Are you happy?" I asked, almost reproachfully.
</p>

<p>
"Happy!" she reiterated, in a tone of voice that was
exquisitely touching; "what said Louise de la Valliere, in.
answer to the same question, when she became a nun: 'I
am not happy; but I am <i>content</i>.'"
</p>

<p>
"Know you not that Rouvigny is dead."
</p>

<p>
"Dead!" she repeated, with clasped hands.
</p>

<p>
"He died after the skirmish at Le Morne Rouge."
</p>

<p>
"May God give peace to his spirit&mdash;I have prayed for
Mm many, many times."
</p>

<p>
"You are now free."
</p>

<p>
"Free!  Oh, Marie mère de Dieu!" she exclaimed,
while the tears fell over her pale face; "I have this day
been elected Superior of the Ursulines.  Go&mdash;go, Monsieur
Oliver; for Heaven's sake leave me.  We must meet no
more; and better had it been for us that we had never met.
You have won your epaulettes; fortune favours you, and
I rejoice at it.  Go on thus, my friend&mdash;my dear friend, and
prosper."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, dear Eulalie."
</p>

<p>
"In the path you must pursue in life Eulalie will soon
be forgotten; but never, while pulsation and human charity
remain in her heart, will she forget to pray for you.  Adieu,
God bless you!"
</p>

<p>
She pressed her hands upon her breast.  I could hear her
sob; I stepped towards her; but she hastily withdrew,
closed the parlour door, and I was left alone.
</p>

<p>
I never saw Eulalie again.
</p>

<p>
To know that she lived and loved me still, but was for
ever separated from me&mdash;that I dared not see, or visit, or
talk with her, and love her in return&mdash;filled me with
perplexity, irritation, and sorrow; but there was no help for
it now.
</p>

<p>
In all this deep interest no thought of marriage ever
occurred to me; in short, I was still too much of a boy to
think of this.  The romance of loving her sufficed for me;
but as some one says, "Did Petrarch ever reflect if Laura
would make a good wife?  Did Oswald ever think it of
Corinne?  Would it not weaken faith in their romantic
passages if you believed it?  What have such practical issues
to do with that passion which sublimates the faculties, and
makes the loving dreamer to live in an ideal sphere, wherein
nothing but goodness and brightness can come?"
</p>

<p>
Then, as I conjured up the fair image of Eulalie, and
thought of the deep mine of tenderness and love which lay
buried in that living tomb at St. Pierre, I hailed with joy
the order that sent us to the conquest of St. Lucia.

<h3>
CHAPTER XLVIII.
<br><br>
LA FLEUR D'EPÉE.
</h3>

<p>
In the Grenadier brigade of Major-General H.R.H. Edward
Duke of Kent (the father of her present Majesty),
the Scots Fusiliers accompanied General Dundas, of
Fingask, with the 6th, 9th, and 43rd regiments, to the
reduction of the fertile and beautiful isle of St. Lucia, which
we reached after two days' sail in hazy and rainy, but calm
weather; and the conquest of which we completed in three
days without the loss of a man, as General Ricard, with all
the soldiers of the republic, capitulated and laid down their
arms.  When Ricard came forth, he had more lorettes under
his colours than rank and file&mdash;hence perhaps the brevity
of his defence.
</p>

<p>
I consider it very remarkable that there was not a single
British soldier or seaman even wounded at the conquest of
St. Lucia, although, as Sir Charles Grey mentions in his
despatch, there had been heavy cannonading from the enemy's
batteries; and in storming one near Morne Fortunée,
Colonel Coote, at the head of four light companies, killed
two French officers, with thirty of their soldiers, and spiked
six pieces of great ordnance.  In Morne Fortunée we found
a vast quantity of plunder and military stores; and every
man got as much rum and sangaree, with yams and
plaintains, as he could carry off.
</p>

<p>
There is an old story of an English ship bound for Guinea,
in the days of Charles I., having marooned sixty mutineers
on this island, when the Caribs&mdash;its former inhabitants,
fierce cannibals, who painted their naked bodies with yellow
ochre, and drew a stripe of vermillion from ear to
ear&mdash;tortured, roasted, and devoured the whole of them.
</p>

<p>
After the capture we left a garrison and re-embarked;
the left wing was on board the <i>Adder</i>, the right on board
the frigate of Lord Garlies, eldest son of the Earl of
Galloway, a gallant Scottish naval officer, who bore a
distinguished part in the reduction of the French Antilles.
</p>

<p>
The rocky islets named Los Santos by the adventurous
Spaniards, who discovered them on the festival of All Saints,
were our next scene of service, and a bloody one it proved.
</p>

<p>
On this expedition, we were despatched with the 1st and
2nd Grenadier battalions, a company of the 43rd Light
Infantry, and 500 picked seamen and marines from the
<i>Quebec</i>, the <i>Rose</i>, and the <i>Adder</i>.  The naval brigade were
led by Sir George Grey, of the <i>Boyne</i>, and the whole of the
forces were under the command of old General Dundas.
</p>

<p>
We sailed from St. Lucia early in the morning; and as
"The Saints" lie only a few miles distant from Martinique,
we found ourselves within gun-shot of them about noon,
when the forests of Marigalante, then about fifteen miles
distant, were drooping in the hot sunshine.
</p>

<p>
These solitary isles are fifteen in number, and were chiefly
frequented by the crews of British and French ships of war,
pirates, slavers, and buccaneers, for the purposes of careening
and refitting.
</p>

<p>
Terre de Bas, the most westerly, has a neat little wooden
church, a few thickets and fields of sugar-cane, with
excellent creeks for landing.
</p>

<p>
Terre de Haut is the most easterly, and the centre
is a large barren rock, the haunt of myriads of sea
birds.
</p>

<p>
The atmosphere, as we approached, was delightfully cool,
as these isles have ever a fresh breeze, let the wind blow
from whatever quarter it may.  As we drew near, they rose
under a dazzling sky, with clouds of that conical form, so
frequently seen in the Antilles, floating over them.  Birds
of gaudy plumage flew about us; around us rippled a sea
of the deepest green, and in its wondrous depth waved
giant plants that sprung from the coral beds a hundred feet
below; and little silvery fishes were sporting among this
saline foliage which was brushed aside by the keels of the
squadron, as we crept in shore.
</p>

<p>
The old palisadoed fort, on which Francis Lord Willoughby
of Parham, unfurled the red cross of St. George in
the olden time, still commanded the chief harbour; but the
French had added many modern works thereto, and all
these we stormed at the point of the bayonet and demolished.
</p>

<p>
On these isles, the buccaneers and filibustiers of former
days&mdash;the compatriots of Kidd, of Morgan, and the terrible
Lolonois&mdash;were said to store their treasure, and to slay a
negro or a prisoner and bury him with it, that his unquiet
spirit might haunt the spot and guard the gold till their
return.  Thus a human skeleton above a hoard of Spanish
dollars and doubloons has more than once been found in the
creeks of Los Santos, as elsewhere in the Indian isles, and on
the shores of the Gulf of Florida.
</p>

<p>
After their capture, the expedition sailed at once to
reduce the isle of Guadaloupe.
</p>

<p>
At one in the morning we crowded into the boats of the
squadron, and in silence put off from our ships in Gosier Bay.
The atmosphere was still and calm, and the vast depth of
the sea could be seen by the clear light of the reflected stars;
thus we could almost distinguish the <i>base</i> of the rocks in
the bay, among the sand and shells, or weeds and coral beds,
below.
</p>

<p>
Eight boats abreast, we dashed into the bay.
</p>

<p>
The earl selected a landing-place where the evergreen
mangroves dipped their branches in the dancing ripples that
ran in silver foam upon the black volcanic rocks, and where
the beach of the creek was covered by layers of those beautiful
shells of silver, blue, and rose colour, the conch used
of old by the savage Carib as a trump for war, and those
marked by musical notes and used&mdash;as the buccaneer traditions
tell&mdash;by the mermaids (and spirits of women drowned
at sea) when singing.  There, too, lay the mother-of-pearl
oysters, which, says an old writer, usually lie at the foot of
the great rocks, appearing at sunrise above the water "to
gape for the clew, and when they have received a drop,
closing their shells, and sinking down again."
</p>

<p>
At the moment our leading line of boats grounded, the
clear sky on both sides of the little bay became filled with
curved lines of vertical light, as a storm of rockets,
ascending from Fort Gosier on one side, and La Fleur d'Epée on
the other, rushed like meteors of fire far aloft, and exploding,
fell in showers of twinkling stars, the descent of which,
enabled the French gunners on the batteries to direct their
shot against us.
</p>

<p>
A large shell from La Fleur d'Epée (the strongest fortress
in Guadaloupe) came revolving and humming through the
air; we could trace its course by the lighted fuse.
</p>

<p>
"Stoop!" cried the earl; "down, lads, down!"
</p>

<p>
It fell harmlessly into the water alongside of the Duke of
Kent's boat; a second that came, exploded near our company.
We saw the brilliant flash among the dark mangrove
leaves, while a blaze of red sparks was thrown upward; at
the same instant a wild cry of agony announced that at least
one poor fellow had fallen by a splinter, and Harry Smith,
the aide-de-camp, lost an epaulette by a cannon-ball, which
wounded his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
These little hints to be speedy were not lost upon us.  We
formed with the utmost rapidity by companies and by
regiments, and moved beyond some ridges which saved us from
the fire of the two forts.  I remember stumbling in the dark
over the prostrate body of a naval officer, who was severely
wounded by the splinter of a shell.  This was the eldest son
of the Earl of Galloway, "Captain Lord Viscount Garlies,
of the <i>Winchelsea</i> frigate, who," as Admiral Jervis states in
his despatch, "acquitted himself with spirit (in the landing)
although he received a bad contusion from the fire of a battery,
against which he had placed his ship <i>in the good old way,
within half-musket shot</i>."
</p>

<p>
In the clear tropical night we could perceive that Fort
Fleur d'Epée was strongly situated on the summit of a hill;
and we advanced towards it through a gorge, Sir George
Grey, of the <i>Boyne</i>, leading the naval brigade, and General
Dundas the troops.  His orders were that in carrying the
place by storm <i>we</i> we were to trust entirely to the
bayonet&mdash;the seamen and marines to pike and cutlass&mdash;and that no
time was to be lost in firing.
</p>

<p>
The morning gun from the <i>Boyne</i>, which lay at anchor in
Gosier Bay, was to be the signal for attack, and while the
general was indicating the various points from which it
would be made, and getting our forces into position, Captain
Glendonwyn and I were sent forward with a flag of truce to
summon the fort to surrender.
</p>

<p>
Through a thicket, amid the foliage of which the fireflies
were flitting in and out of sight, we made our way to
the base of the hill, and when within musket-shot desired
our drummer to beat a parley.  The sound was immediately
answered by a drum within the fort, and we proceeded over
a bridge, beneath which a waterfall was pouring like a
torrent of liquid silver.  From thence we passed through
an alley in an orange-grove, the old trees of which were
interwoven by an all but impenetrable mass of green
tracery&mdash;the fibres and foliage of the creepers that clung from
branch to branch.  There, too, crawled and croaked the
crapaud, or huge brown toad, the aspect of which was
enough to fill with qualms even those, who in less than
half an hour, would be rushing on with the desperate
stormers.
</p>

<p>
On approaching the outer palisades, we were received by
a guard under arms, and a number of officers, whose grimly
bronzed faces and faded uniforms, were visible by the light
of a large lantern.  Around them hovered a crowd of blacks
and mulattoes, armed with muskets, and wearing crossbelts
over their sable chests or cotton shirts.  Many had also
hatchets and sabres.
</p>

<p>
"Qui vive?" challenged a sentry of the French line.
</p>

<p>
"A flag of truce," replied Glendonwyn.
</p>

<p>
"Addressed to whom?"
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur le Colonel Du Plessis, commandant of La
Fleur d'Epée."
</p>

<p>
"Advance, monsieur l'officier&mdash;the colonel is here,"
replied the sentinel, presenting arms.
</p>

<p>
"Speak, sir," said a tall, stern officer, whose long grey
hair fell in the wavy fashion of the republic over the rolling
collar of his plain grey great-coat, which was buttoned up
to the throat, where his gilt gorget was suspended by
a tricoloured ribbon.  "I am he you seek," he added,
saluting us.
</p>

<p>
M. Du Plessis was a solemn and gloomy man; and his
story, which we knew well, was a singular one.
</p>

<p>
In the year of the revolution and fall of the Bastille, he
had been a private in one of the battalions of the Régiment
de Turenne, but revolted.  In a night attack made by the
Chevalier Adrien de Losme, with a "handful" of the
French guards, on a barricade in the Rue de Clichy, Du
Plessis was involved in a deadly <i>mêlée</i> with the royalist
troops, whose standard-bearer he encountered hand to hand
in the dark, and on the summit of the hastily-constructed
barrier, Du Plessis was victor.  Thrice he ran the royalist
through the body, and as he placed a foot upon the fallen
corpse, its face was turned towards him; a ray of light fell
on it, and the miserable man discovered that he had slain
his&mdash;own father!
</p>

<p>
From that hour he was changed and gloomy.  He made
a vow that he would die in action.  Even as he uttered this
vow a shot struck his breast, and he fell.  On examining the
supposed wound, it was found "that the ball had been
stopped," as Dutriel (who told me the anecdote) related,
"by a scapular of the Virgin which he wore.  The mark of
the ball remained on the piece of cloth, but Du Plessis was
untouched; and though he ever did his duty as became a
soldier, since that night of horror in the Rue de Clichy he
had lived with the severity of a monk of La Trappe."
</p>

<p>
As these strange episodes recurred to me, I surveyed the
general with some interest.
</p>

<p>
"If you come, messieurs, to demand a capitulation, your
errand is fruitless," said he.
</p>

<p>
"Such <i>is</i> my errand," replied Glendonwyn; "you are
invested on every side."
</p>

<p>
"Ah&mdash;we thought as much," was the careless answer.
</p>

<p>
"How long, then, monsieur le général, do you propose to
hold out?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ma foi!</i> till death," was the stern reply.
</p>

<p>
"Life is better."
</p>

<p>
"Life is worthless to Frenchmen, if honour be lost," was
the somewhat vain reply.  "Adieu, messieurs;" and the
wicket was shut in our faces.
</p>

<p>
With this reply we returned to the general, who said
coolly, while he glanced at his watch,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;we shall beat up his quarters in half an hour.
What sound is that?" he asked, as a strain of music stole
upon the calm morning air.
</p>

<p>
"The French band playing <i>Ca ira</i>," said I.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, very well; we'll change their tune when we give
them gunpowder for breakfast."
</p>

<p>
All eyes were now turned to the <i>Boyne</i>, which lay in the
bay, with her black hull, squared yards, and lofty rigging
distinctly defined upon the clear whitening bosom of the
water, which seemed, in the peculiar state of the atmosphere,
like a sheet of milk, far down below the black groves and
rocks of the island.
</p>

<p>
The ships' bells struck <i>five</i> in varying cadence.
</p>

<p>
With breathless impatience we awaited the signal!
</p>

<p>
Gradually a faint streak of light began to brighten the
edge of the distant sea; a quivering ray from the sun, yet
far below the horizon, played on the gauze-like clouds above
it, and then a heavy boom, with a red flash from the
frigate's starboard bow, made every heart in the brigade to
leap in response.
</p>

<p>
"The morning gun!" said one.
</p>

<p>
"The warning&mdash;the signal!" exclaimed others, in loud
whispers.
</p>

<p>
"Stormers to the front&mdash;forward, double quick!" cried
the Earl of Kildonan, in a loud and firm voice.
</p>

<p>
Then, with that ringing hurrah which comes from British
lungs alone, we dashed in masses towards La Fleur d'Epée.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XLIX.
<br><br>
THE ASSAULT.
</h3>

<p>
In the twilight we pressed on, through bright green
groves studded by brighter golden oranges; through the
flame-coloured leaves of the wondrous <i>Bois-immortel</i>;
through thickets of cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove-shrub
trees, till we found ourselves at the base of the hill of La
Fleur d'Epée, the sides of which were in a moment covered
by the assailants&mdash;soldiers, seamen, and marines&mdash;scrambling
up, under a tremendous fire of grape and musketry, round-shot,
shell, and hand-grenades.  The whole fortress seemed
to be covered by flame, so incessant was the firing that
flashed through every loophole and embrasure&mdash;over the
stone parapets, and through the wooden palisades.  Numbers
of shells burst as they rose, revolving in mid-air, and their
falling fragments killed and wounded several of our men;
while, as they exploded elsewhere, pillars of black smoke
and earth covered all the slope of the hill.
</p>

<p>
Led by the captain of the <i>Boyne</i>, the active seamen, with
their pikes and cutlasses, were first at the outer palisade.
Old Cranky, who was stuck all over pistols, like Paul Jones
in the play, came next; and his solitary eye glared round
him with grim satisfaction as he perceived his former
antagonist, the earl, entering with him side by side, for he was
too brave to bear a grudge at any man.
</p>

<p>
The French advanced work was soon taken&mdash;their inlying
picket, or mainguard were all shot down or bayoneted;
and many of our sailors, with the activity of monkeys,
sprang into the embrasures&mdash;through which the levelled
cannon were belching shot and flame&mdash;and there fought
hand to hand with the gunners and linesmen, who crowded
together on the ramparts; while we, with the battalion of
grenadier companies, dashed in the gates, and then a
dreadful conflict with the bayonet ensued, for the blacks and
malattoes who mingled with the French line fought like
incarnate fiends.  The storming became a series of duels, in
which many perished on both sides, and some frightful
wounds were given by point and edge and clubbed musket,
before they yielded, and threw down their arms in
disorder.
</p>

<p>
Every shot found a hundred echoes in the cliffs of Morne
Mascot, which overhung us, and in the distance we heard the
sound of musketry as the General, Sir Charles Grey,
assailed and stormed the batteries of Fort Louis and the Isle
of Hogs, which commanded the harbour of Point à Pitre.
</p>

<p>
In the <i>mêlée</i> I have described we lost our senior captain,
John Macdonald of Kinlochmoidart, a soldier worthy of the
gallant race from which he sprang, and ever ready to lead in
desperate work.  His family having (as Glendonwyn phrased
it) "come down the brae wi' the auld Stuarts," he was
animated by all the pride and high courage of the palmiest
days of Celtic chivalry; but a ball from the upper rampart
pierced his breast; he fell, and the hand of his old friend
Glendonwyn was the first to assist him.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Glenny, I am wounded&mdash;mortally wounded!"
he exclaimed, and fainted.
</p>

<p>
"Carry him to the rear," cried the Earl of Kildonan,
whose cheek was streaming with blood, having been laid
open by a sabre; "he comes of a race that have seldom died
on other bed than this."
</p>

<p>
He was borne out of the press, and conveyed on board the
<i>Winchelsea</i>, but died of his wound soon after the capture of
Guadaloupe.
</p>

<p>
Colonel du Plessis refused to surrender, and, after a severe
single combat, was disarmed and made prisoner by Jack
Haystone, the lieutenant of our company.  Just as he was
leaning breathlessly on the sword of the French commandant,
a ball shivered the blade in his hand.  Haystone fell flat on
his face, and at that moment a French grenadier, despite the
entreaties of Du Plessis, was about to bayonet him, when
Jack exclaimed in French, which he spoke fluently,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Hold!  I have a favour to ask."
</p>

<p>
"Say it," said the soldier, raising his threatening weapon.
</p>

<p>
"If you <i>will</i> stab me, let it be in the breast, that I may
die at once, and lest my body be found with a dishonourable
wound."
</p>

<p>
"Rise, <i>mon capitaine</i>&mdash;I am one of the old Régiment de
Turenne!" said the grenadier proudly and sullenly, as he
flung down his musket.
</p>

<p>
The scene about the shattered gate as day dawned was
revolting.  The dead and wounded lay there in literal <i>heaps</i>,
and among the former was my poor friend Jack Joyce, the
marine, who had been shot through the lungs.  In one place
where a large shell had exploded I counted about twenty
dead men all huddled together.
</p>

<p>
Elsewhere, I saw that many of the wounded retained the
attitudes they had assumed when death-shots struck them.
Here lay a man reclined against a bastion, with a handless
arm upraised; there lay another whose head and breast had
been torn to pieces by a shower of canister.  Close by was
an officer with his handkerchief stuffed into his breast, and
drenched with the blood of a wound from which the last
life-drops were oozing, as his eyelids drooped and his eyes glazed
mournfully over.  Across a heap of bodies, a mustachoed
grenadier of the old 37th, or King Louis's, lay on his back;
the left hand yet grasped the musket, and in his clenched
teeth was the half-bitten cartridge, the black powder of
which was mingled with the blood and foam that left his
pallid lips together, matting about his black beard and
mustachoes.
</p>

<p>
Our Scots Fusiliers suffered severely, and lost there many
a poor lad who had first heard the drum beaten and the fife
blown "for glory" at the village fair, or in the pastoral glen
where his father's cottage stood; but now, all gashed and
dead, they would hear that fife and drum no more!  Amid
all this horrible <i>débris</i>, I remember perceiving a French
officer, standing a little apart from the prisoners, with his
epaulettes in his hands.  Lord Kildonan inquired the reason
of this.
</p>

<p>
"To avoid the indignity of having them torn from my
shoulders," he replied, haughtily.
</p>

<p>
"Torn!&mdash;by whom?"
</p>

<p>
"Plunderers.  I have worn these epaulettes at Versailles&mdash;ay,
in the same quadrille with Marie Antoinette.  I have worn
them in battle against the Austrians, and I would not have
them desecrated."
</p>

<p>
"Then replace them, monsieur," said the earl; "it is not
the custom of British soldiers to plunder either the living or
the dead."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Williams, our minister, in his account of this affair,
says: "Being the only chaplain present, I went up early in
the evening, as soon as the action was over, to bury the dead.
At the foot of the hill lay several of our seamen badly
wounded.  A little further on, under some tall trees, were
several naval officers reposing after the fatigues of the
morning; their men were not far from them.  Further on a party
of wounded prisoners were brought in by our people, and at
the gates of the fort lay a heap of slain, who had died by the
sword or the bayonet.  Within it lay a multitude of miserable
creatures expiring of their wounds, and many of our
own people in the same situation.  In the midst of this his
Excellency [Sir Charles Grey] was writing his despatches, at
a table on which lay an artilleryman sleeping, being overcome
with fatigue, and the good general would not allow him
to be disturbed."
</p>

<p>
After the slaughter and horrors we had witnessed, there
was something quite refreshing in the humane sentiment,
that prevented our gallant old leader from rousing the
worn-out gunner, who had fallen asleep on a table brought forth
from Du Plessis' quarters, for the use of the staff.
</p>

<p>
We had seventy-five killed and wounded in capturing
this small fort.  Of the French, including blacks and
mulattoes, there were killed and taken two hundred and
thirty-two.
</p>

<p>
Such was the storming of Fort Fleur d'Epée, in the island
of Guadaloupe, by our losses at which I won my first lieutenantcy.

<h3>
CHAPTER L.
<br><br>
"SMITH" OF THE ROYALS.
</h3>

<p>
Flushed by this new conquest, "Hispaniola," was now
our <i>cri de guerre</i>; and while troops, prisoners, sick and
wounded were all re-embarked, and the squadron, after
being careened and refitted, prepared to unite, previous to
attacking that large and valuable island (an intention
never carried out), I was ordered to convey thirty French
civilians under a cartel to Dominica, while Harry Smith of
the Royals, the aide-de-camp, who, as already related, had
been wounded by a cannon-shot on our landing, was ordered
to convey stores, despatches, and a few captured slaves to
Jamaica.  For these services, two large ships, formerly
privateers (<i>L'Etna</i> and <i>L'Ami du Peuple</i>), which we found
concealed in a cove at Terre d'en Haut, were fitted for sea
by the carpenters and riggers of the <i>Adder</i>.  Captain
Cranky sent a small but well-armed prize-crew under a
midshipman on board of each.  Smith who was in love with
a girl in Jamaica, where he had formerly been stationed,
accepted his duty with joy; but I bade adieu to my
comrades with a regret that almost amounted to a foreboding,
and shifted my traps on board the <i>Etna</i>.  He with his
sable charge, and I with my jabbering Frenchmen separated,
and with a fair wind we bore away from the rocky isles of
Los Santos.
</p>

<p>
Neither of us sailed under convoy; we had no fear of
French ships of war, or privateers, as old Sir John Jervis
had swept them alike from the Leeward and Windward Isles,
and all the Caribean sea.
</p>

<p>
<i>L'Etna</i> was a smart and sharply-built vessel, with a low
hull, raking masts, pierced for eight twelve-pounders, and
all painted black.  While in French hands, she did great
damage to our West-India trade.  Mr. Stanley, a midshipman
of the <i>Adder</i>, commanded the prize-crew.
</p>

<p>
We stood down the Canal des Saintes, and after rounding
Point du Vieux Fort of Guadaloupe, we lost sight of
Harry Smith's craft, which bore away into the Caribean Sea,
while we hauled up for Dominica, on a lovely evening, when
the sky was all of a warm lilac hue, which paled to blue as
the golden sun sank down and vanished like a flaming
shield.
</p>

<p>
After our separation, the adventures of both were very
remarkable.  Poor Harry's, at that time, made much more
noise than mine, being full of romance, notwithstanding his
most unromantic surname; and a narrative of these, written
by Haystone of ours, appeared in more than one public
journal.  As he and they are alike forgotten now, before
resuming the thread of my own story, I will briefly relate
the strange catastrophe which befell the unfortunate
aide-de-camp.
</p>

<p>
<i>L'Ami du Peuple</i>, after encountering a gale of wind which
carried away her topmasts, reached Jamaica; where Smith,
after landing his stores and his sable detachment, hastened
to the house of M. du Plessis, to whose daughter, Aurore,
he was deeply attached.  Many of our fellows at this time
got themselves into scrapes with the pretty Creoles and
Frenchwomen of colour, natheless all the serious
disadvantages of making love when in a profuse state of
perspiration to a pale damsel who could, to all appearance,
remain cool as a cucumber, when the thermometer stood at
ninety in the shade, and her European swain was in a
melting mood in more ways than one.
</p>

<p>
Some time before, when Smith was quartered in Jamaica,
Kingston had been full of French royalist emigrants or
fugitives from the Antilles; and many of these, from being
persons of opulence and good position, by their flight and
loss of fortune, had been reduced to extreme penury.  Most
of these emigrants were from Martinique, Marigalante, and Los
Santos; but by far the greater number were from Hispaniola.
Among those from the latter island, were M. du Plessis,
(brother of the colonel whose capture I have just related)
and his daughter, Aurore, with a few servants in whom he
confided, or who choose to follow his fallen fortune.  After
his arrival, these were forced, by the pressure of circumstances,
to leave him, all, save one, named Scipio, a gigantic
negro, to whom he was much attached, although a subtle
savage, who, for a time, had served in the coloured bands of
Bellegarde and Pelocque.
</p>

<p>
Aurore was a French girl who possessed a delicacy of
beauty that seldom falls to the lot of her countrywomen;
but a West-Indian sun often works wonders, for although
barely sixteen, she was "rich in all the fascinations of tropical
girlishness;" and unmelted by the fiery skies of those
regions, her cheeks wore a tinge of red, and ripe as those
of any English girl at home; but much of the beauty of
Aurore was inherited from her mother, who was descended
from the old Spanish settlers in Hispaniola.
</p>

<p>
In Kingston, the lively little French beauty had many
admirers, but she preferred to all others Harry Smith, of
the Scots Royals, whose handsome figure and face were
displayed to advantage by his brilliant staff uniform.  He had
fine dark eyes, which generally played the deuce with ladies,
who always averred they beheld "in them a deep expression
of tenderness not to be described," and so forth; yet I had
seen them fiery and stern enough at such times as when the
cannon ball from La Fleur d'Epée shaved off his epaulette
and a slice off his shoulder with it.  In short, he was the <i>beau
idéal</i> of a smart and gentlemanly young officer, without a
vestige of the fop about him&mdash;for he had seen too much
service during the six years he had been in the Royals&mdash;"too
many hard knocks" as the mess-room phrase is&mdash;to be
guilty of such folly; and so little Mademoiselle Aurore
loved him with all her heart.
</p>

<p>
On his return to Jamaica, full of the ardour so natural to
a young lover, Harry hastened to the house of M. du Plessis,
but found, that though the letters of Aurore expressed an
undiminished affection, a great change had taken place in
the sentiments of the old planter, her father.
</p>

<p>
News (which, however, proved false) had arrived at
Kingston, that the second division of the army from old
France, destined to crush the insurgent slaves in the French
Antilles, had reached the island of Hispaniola; and M. du
Plessis, elated by the prospect of a restoration to fortune
and to his extensive estates and plantations, now avowed
that which hitherto he had the cunning or the wicked
policy to conceal, a decided repugnance for Lieutenant
Smith, and refused to permit Aurore to receive his visits.
</p>

<p>
Harry was as if thunder-struck!  He sued, he entreated,
he stormed, and poor Aurore was in despair.  She wept
and prayed, but M. du Plessis remained as inexorable as
any father in an old melodrama, and embarked on board
of a ship sailing under a cartel, with his wife, his property,
and all his black servants whom he had collected&mdash;the
faithful Scipio included.  Poor Harry sprang into a boat, and
though still suffering from the effects of his wound, reached
the ship, which was then almost ready for sea, and lay in the
harbour of Kingston, with her cable hove short upon the
anchor, her courses loose, and blue-peter flying at the fore.
</p>

<p>
With her face covered by a veil, Aurore was seated on
the deck; her head reclined upon her mother's breast, and
she wept as if her heart was breaking.
</p>

<p>
Harry approached again; desperation lent him an eloquence
that he knew not he possessed, and he urged his suit
with the bearing of a gentleman, and with passion, truth,
and tenderness.  Du Plessis stood with arms folded, and,
after hearing him in contemptuous silence&mdash;for he seemed
to exult in his power to crush and mortify a Briton&mdash;ordered
him at once to leave the ship, and added some coarse and
ungenerous reflections on his country, and on his faith as a
Protestant.  Finding that pathos and argument alike proved
futile, Harry became filled by a sudden fury, and unsheathed
his sword.
</p>

<p>
"Listen to me, Monsieur du Plessis, you are both insolent
and hard of heart," he exclaimed; "nothing but the love I
bear Aurore, and the respect I am forced to have for you as
<i>her</i> father, prevents me from running you through the body
and killing you on the spot!  You will tear her from me&mdash;my
dear, dear Aurore!  Be it so; but thus shall she see
that I can never survive her loss!"
</p>

<p>
With these words, the desperate fellow dashed his sword
at the feet of the startled planter, and springing overboard,
sank instantly.
</p>

<p>
Boats were promptly lowered to pick him up, but he
never rose again.*
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* "His unfortunate father, who was in Kingston, when the news
reached him, in vain offered a reward of £200 to any person who
would bring him the body of his son; but it was never
found."&mdash;<i>Scottish Reg.</i> 1794.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Aurore was borne to her cabin in a state of alternate
insensibility and delirium, and in this condition she
continued, when, on the evening of the third day, while the
mountains of Hispaniola were in sight, Scipio and the other
domestics, armed with knives, rose suddenly in the twilight,
and, with circumstances of dreadful barbarity, murdered
every white person on board, except the miserable girl on
whom the "faithful" Scipio pounced as his own particular
prey.  The negroes then plundered and set fire to the ship,
and, leaving the corpses to the spreading flames, went ashore
in the largest boat, and, taking Aurore with them, joined
the revolted slaves who were still in arms, and who, since
the massacre of the whites in August, 1791, had made that
beautiful isle a scene of death and desolation.
</p>

<p>
From that night all trace was lost for ever of the
unfortunate Mademoiselle du Plessis.

<h3>
CHAPTER LI.
<br><br>
THE HURRICANE.
</h3>

<p>
I have mentioned that <i>L'Ami du Peuple</i>, the ship in
which Smith sailed for Jamaica, had her topmasts carried
away by a gale of wind.  This occurred when she was
somewhere off the long shoal, known as the Avis bank; and the
gale was but the skirt of a fearful hurricane, which we also
encountered, and by which we were driven as far as to
north latitude 15.30, and west longitude 63.15.
</p>

<p>
The day when Stanley made this observation had been
wonderfully serene, even for the tropics; and as evening
drew on, a warm lilac tint spread over sea and sky.  The
wind became variable&mdash;by turns stiff and light; the sails
at times flapped heavily, and the loose cordage alternately
blew out in wide bends, or hung listlessly and still.  At
such times the <i>Etna</i> rolled drowsily, for there was a
mountainous swell upon the glassy sea.
</p>

<p>
Stanley, the middy in command, seemed to dislike the
aspect of the sky; it puzzled him, and he frequently
conferred with the older seamen of his crew, who, while
acknowledging that they thought the appearance of the
atmosphere boded something, added, they "would not have
cared about it the value of a quid of bacca, but for that 'ere
matter of the rats."
</p>

<p>
It would seem that the <i>Etna</i>, when first found at Los
Santos was infested by thousands of Barbadoes rats, all of
which had disappeared when she was refitted for sea; and
the old proverb, that "rats leave dangerous places," was
repeated gloomily as evening turned into night, and the
men of the watch talked under their breath, and rehearsed
to each other many a gloomy legend of dangers, to which
similar disappearances had been the ominous introduction.
</p>

<p>
The wind was easterly, and, contrary to the general
experience of those who have traversed the Caribean sea, we
found it increase in strength, instead of sinking after
sunset&mdash;till it blew so freshly that sail was taken off the ship.
</p>

<p>
The atmosphere became thick and misty; like a luminous
lamp the red moon appeared for a time at the horizon, and
the black and tumbling waves seemed to roll against its
disc; but as the haze increased we lost sight of it
altogether.  Dense black clouds came rapidly up from the
north-west, and as they hurried along, they seemed to meet
and be torn asunder by the contrary current from the east,
which bore us swiftly on.  The agitation of the sea
increased, and now the waves, that seethed and boiled around
us, emitted a strong sulphureous odour.  Every moment
the wind seemed to grow stronger, and appeared to blow
from every point at once.
</p>

<p>
These phenomena, though not uncommon in those
latitudes, made Stanley and his crew anxious.
</p>

<p>
The sails were still more reduced; the topgallant yards
were sent down, the topmasts struck, and every means were
taken to make the vessel snug; but she pitched and groaned
fearfully; while the atmosphere became more dense, more
black, and stifling every moment.
</p>

<p>
I was sitting under the recess of the poop deck, when
suddenly cries of astonishment, if not of fear, burst from the
seamen; then their voices were lost in a stupendous sound,
like the roaring of a mighty cataract, mingled with the
rolling of thunder, while a wondrous gleam of red and
ghastly light overspread the sea, revealing every crested
wave that rolled in long and watery ridges towards us, and
every spar, rope, and block of the vessel's rigging in a glare
as from a mighty conflagration.
</p>

<p>
By one bound I gained the summit of the poop-ladder,
and grasping the mizen shrouds, beheld one of those terrible
phenomena incident to these tropical seas,&mdash;a sight never to
be forgotten.
</p>

<p>
About six miles distant, on our lee-bow, a mighty pyramid
of fire was rising from the sea, as if millions of rockets were
being vomited forth; the roaring of the water that seethed
around the crater of this submarine volcano&mdash;for it was one of
those terrible examples which Kircher first records as having
witnessed in the Azores&mdash;had a dreadful sound; and the
sulphureous ashes that mingled with the salt steam, and fell
like a snow-storm on our deck, were so suffocating that two
men became insensible.  This thick white powder continued
to fall so fast that our persons, the deck, the guns, the
rigging, masts, and yards, speedily became as if coated with
flour; and the entire ship, in all her details, assumed a
phantom-like aspect, as she glided on amid this terrific
glare, which for nearly ten minutes overspread the ocean,
and made it resemble a sea of flame.
</p>

<p>
Anon the light sank slowly down; the radiance faded
away, and then we heard the angry and hollow roaring of
the sea as it was sucked down into the mighty depth of some
submarine crater or vortex, the physical construction of
which was beyond our conception; but the reflux of the
water boiled in hot and seething foam around us, while the
spray that flew over the ship to leeward was warm, and
became crusted salt in a moment, on the guns, booms, and
shrouds.
</p>

<p>
Many of our seamen and passengers became almost
paralysed by astonishment, and we found ourselves all but
overwhelmed by the ashy torrent that had fallen upon us,
and, amid which, in the gloom that succeeded, our figures
seemed like those of indistinct spectres; but now the roaring
of the wind, and increasing turbulence of the sea, recalled us
to our senses by the natural instinct of self-preservation, for
all the skill of seamanship was speedily required.  The
yards were squared, the <i>Etna</i> was set before the wind, and we
lost no time in spreading every inch of canvas we dared, to
escape from the spot; thus, our old privateer flew before the
rising tempest and the rolling sea like a veritable phantom
ship.*
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* In 1720 a column of fire sprang from the sea near Tercera, when
an island arose above the surface; and in February, 1811, similar
events occurred at the western extremity of the island of St. Michael,
when the flames are said to have "risen into the air like a host of
sky-rockets, with the usual accompaniments of smoke, ashes, and noise."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
By the compass, the <i>Etna's</i> head lay nearly due north.
</p>

<p>
The wind soon freed us from the sulphureous ashes which
covered our persons and the ship, but the crystalline salt of
the spray lay thick and white as hoar frost upon the deck,
the gunnels, and studding-sail booms alongside.
</p>

<p>
The wind still freshened, but a stiff glass of brandy-and-water,
together with our excitement, enabled us to pass the
night without once thinking of turning in; and by
day-dawn we saw land rising under a leaden-hued sky, from a
grey and angry sea on our starboard bow, and it was about
ten miles off on our beam about one o'clock.
</p>

<p>
"What do you make it out to be?" I asked Stanley, who
was gazing anxiously through his telescope.
</p>

<p>
"An island," was the curt reply.
</p>

<p>
"Of course,&mdash;but what island?"
</p>

<p>
"Avis, by the chart,&mdash;and Avis it must be by the clouds
of birds above it."
</p>

<p>
"But there are no trees visible."
</p>

<p>
"The birds lay their eggs in the sand.  It is rendered a
dangerous place by the number of rocks about; a whole
French fleet was wrecked there under the Admiral d'Estres.
I have seen old guns lying on the rocks, when off the island
in the <i>Adder's</i> boats.  Keep her away a point or so to the
eastward,&mdash;call the watch and stand by to stow the
main-sail and jib."
</p>

<p>
As the louring day wore on, Stanley became more
anxious, and ere long he took the wheel himself, for he was
a good seaman as well as a brave young officer.  The rocks
of Avis soon vanished into the grey obscurity astern, and
then I heard Stanley, after assuming his speaking-trumpet,
bellow through the gathering gale,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Double reef the fore and maintopsails&mdash;stow the
mizentopsail! quick my lads, or they will be blown from the
bolt ropes, or the sticks will go smash by the board."
</p>

<p>
Amid the furious flapping of the canvas and the roaring
of the wind, I heard the voices of the seamen aloft,
encouraging each other cheerily as they fulfilled their orders
with all the speed and readiness of regular men-of-war's-men.
</p>

<p>
The sea was so heavy that at times we seemed to be
rushing through successive sheets of snow-white foam, and
the vessel began to labour greatly.  Towards evening we
had a glimpse of the sun.  Fiery and blood-red, his mighty
disc, shorn of every ray, glared at the horizon for a brief
space along the waste of seething ocean over which we
were careering wildly.  We saw&mdash;but for a moment&mdash;a
merchant brig under jury-masts, running on the opposite
tack; she was lifted by the reddened sea against this glowing
orb.  For an instant her black outline, her masts, sails,
and bowsprit, were distinct and clear; but the next she was
swept away, and we lost sight of her in the dusk and drift
as the sun went down, and the clouds of dun and fiery
purple piled up like a huge bank, soon to be torn asunder
by the wind, enveloped the place of his setting.
</p>

<p>
The pumps were sounded every half-hour; but the
vessel proved tight, and no greater quantity of water than
usual was found in them.  As the twilight deepened,
finding that she began to lurch and roll like a water-logged
ship, and that the gale seemed rather to increase than
abate, I roused Stanley, who was exhausted and lay under
the recess of the poop-deck, asleep.  Just as he rose, a
mighty wave struck the ship.  The volume of dark and
foaming water burst in thunder on her starboard quarter,
and tearing the boat which hung there from its davits,
swept it like a cork away into the trough of the sea.
</p>

<p>
"Stand by all hands to heave the guns overboard&mdash;clear
the deck&mdash;heave over shot and everything to lighten her!"
were now Stanley's orders.
</p>

<p>
By a rope at the breech and button, and handspikes under
the trunnions, our eight 12-pounders, with all their shot and
gear, were hoisted over the side and sent surging to the
weedy depths below; while we were thus engaged, another
dreadful sea struck the ship and swept away the long-boat
which was full of live-stock, snapping like silk threads the
lashings which bound it to the deck, and carrying it
completely over the side, together with two of our men.
</p>

<p>
The gale was now approaching to a hurricane; but as the
<i>Etna</i> sailed bravely, she was hauled to the wind on the port tack.
</p>

<p>
"Double reef the fore and main-topsail, and lower the
yards down on the cap!" was now the order of Stanley.
</p>

<p>
In a minute after this she gave a mighty lurch, and rolled
right over on her beam-ends to starboard, and thus she lay
helplessly, with her mast-heads in the sea, the waves of
which were roaring, bellowing, and foaming, as if each was
rivalling the other in efforts to sink or rend her to pieces.
</p>

<p>
Clinging to the larboard side of the poop, I got upon the
mizen rattlins, which were still a few feet above the sea,
and there, though drenched with the spray which flew in
showers over me, I had time to breathe&mdash;-to utter a few pious
invocations&mdash;to collect my thoughts and look about me.
</p>

<p>
I beheld, so far as the darkness, the drifting spray, and
the incessant motion of the foundering ship permitted me,
a scene of horror, such as I had often read of&mdash;often
imagined&mdash;but never expected to witness or experience.
Shrieks to God for aid, mingled with the hollow bellowing
of the wind and the roar of the destroying waves, as man
after man was torn from the rattlins, the yards, or
timber-heads, as the death-clutch failed, and he was swept away
into the waste of water, or was dashed again and again by
succeeding waves against the wreck.  All this when viewed
through the darkness of a tempestuous night was
terrible&mdash;beyond all description terrible!
</p>

<p>
Wave after wave burst in thundering volume over me,
confusing, drenching, and benumbing me; yet I clung
desperately to my perch in the mizen rattlins, which were
now horizontal, and with each successive sea that struck the
wreck sank lower and lower in the water.
</p>

<p>
Life I wanted now&mdash;life under any circumstances, however
wretched!  Every thought, energy, and faculty became
excited, and merged in the passionate longing for life, for
self-preservation.
</p>

<p>
A portion of the maintopsail was still above water; but
a mighty wave burst into it and tore away the now horizontal
mast with all its gear, and swept it far from the ship into
darkness, and with it went poor Stanley and four of his seamen.
</p>

<p>
By this time I could only see four other men clinging to
different parts of the wreck.  I called to them repeatedly,
but without receiving an answer.  They seemed to be
stupified.  As Falconer says,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  A while they bore th' overwhelming billow's rage<br>
  Unequal combat with their fate to wage;<br>
  Till all benumb'd and feeble they forego<br>
  Their slippery holds, and sink to shades below,<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
and ere long I found myself alone&mdash;alone on that surging
sea and shattered wreck.
</p>

<p>
Men toil and struggle bravely, when love, when liberty,
and, more than all, when <i>life</i> is at stake.  So struggled I on
that night of terror.
</p>

<p>
Clutching fast the wetted shrouds, worn and exhausted
by long exposure, by want of sleep, and by excitement, I
hoped the hope of the desperate&mdash;that, with daybreak, if the
ship floated so long, aid might come; a friendly sail might
pass, and I might yet be saved, and spared for years to
come: yet what right had I to be favoured so specially,
when so many poor fellows had perished?  The brave, the
good, the hardy, and the true!
</p>

<p>
Strangely enough, at that terrible time frivolous thoughts
and trivial incidents of my past years came before me.  I
counted the rattlins on the shrouds, and watched, with a
species of ghastly curiosity or vacant wonder, the snapping
of the ship's gear in succession, as the billows broke in foam
among the prostrate masts and yards, and shattered
top-hamper; and then I would long and pray for the dawn of
morning.
</p>

<p>
The hazy gloom around me was oppressive.  I clung as in
a dream, mechanically; I scarcely knew at one time whether
I was asleep or awake, till suddenly the horrible conviction
came over me, that the vessel was settling down, and <i>sinking
fast</i>!  The broken masts, all shattered now to their round
tops, rose slowly and gradually from the water.  For some
minutes they remained at an angle of forty-five degrees from
the surface, and then became more and more erect, as the
vessel righted, and sank deeper in the sea, assuming, as she
sank, her natural position.
</p>

<p>
Down&mdash;down she went, slowly, surely, and gradually, the
waves rolling, as it were, in wild joy over her entire hull.
I soon lost sight of the deck, and, as the water approached,
I continued to ascend the rattlins until I reached the
mizentop.  The storm was abating, for the bellowing and fury of
the wind were much less; but this change of weather availed
me little now, for I had barely reached the mizentop when
it vanished, with the last vestiges of the ship into the sea
beneath me, and I was tossed hither and thither among the
waves.  Blinded by spray, and haunted by a fear of sharks,
and of the same death by which so many of my late
companions had perished, I was not aware for some time that,
by chance, or perhaps by that species of attraction by which
two bodies or floating substances are drawn together in the
water, a topgallant-yard remained close by me, till suddenly,
with a sigh of joy, I threw out my arms and clung to it.
Again and again I was tossed up among the white foam on
the summit of a wave, and then precipitated into the black
trough of the sea, twenty feet below; and thus I was rapidly
borne hundreds of yards from the place where our hapless ship
had foundered, but still I retained my hold.
</p>

<p>
Then I found, as the dashing of the waves became less,
that I was among some of those gigantic plants which grow
from the bottom of the sea in these regions, being like
prodigious water-docks, with stems eighty or a hundred feet
long, and mighty leaves covered with brown slime; and
under these the <i>blue shark</i> glides ever in search of prey.
If aught could increase the horror of my situation, it was
being swept here and there among these giant weeds, with
the incessant dread of being snapped in two by the teeth of
the monster fish.
</p>

<p>
I was becoming careless, weary, and incapable of further
exertion, when a wave, larger than any I had hitherto seen,
burst like a mountain over me.  I felt a mighty shock, and,
while believing that all was over, became insensible; yet
God was pleased to spare me.

<h3>
CHAPTER LII.
<br><br>
THE DESERT ISLAND.
</h3>

<p>
When consciousness returned, I felt on my face the
warmth of a hot sunshine, and my first impulse was to strike
out and swim, as if still in the ocean.  Then starting
convulsively, I rose slowly and giddily to find that I had been
lying on a dry shingly beach, about two yards from the
verge of the sea, which was calm as a mirror, and rippled
like an inland lake upon "the unnumbered pebbles" and
thick layers of beautiful shells that lay along this unknown
shore.
</p>

<p>
Behind me rose steep black rocks, covered with green
waving woods that fringed their summits, and close by lay
the spar, by clinging to which my life had probably been
saved.  A few tortoises were crawling near it, on the
shingle.  After pausing to rally thought and power of
action, I started to my feet, and looked around me.  My
clothes, a uniform coat and blue pantaloons with Hessian
boots, were still moist with my recent immersion; but the
saline property of the sea water prevented it from causing
ague or other illness.
</p>

<p>
By the sun's altitude, I judged the time to be about ten
in the morning; for my watch had stopped soon after I had
been precipitated from the mizen rattlins into the sea.
</p>

<p>
The rays were scorching now, and they shone with a
glitter and brilliance upon the grey rocks and palmetto
groves above me, and with a transparency, which, by making
them appear to vibrate, gave an idea of the heat being
almost <i>visible</i>.  At a little distance, some monkeys of the
smallest size with long bushy tails were skipping about, and
I saw the gaily-pinioned flamingoes flitting from branch to
branch; but near me there was no sound, save the gurgling
ripple on the beach&mdash;not even the hum of the smallest
insect.
</p>

<p>
Far away to the vast circle of the horizon, stretched the
ocean in profound calm.  Its waters were of the lightest
blue, and no spot or sail appeared upon their glassy and
glowing surface.
</p>

<p>
Thirst now oppressed me, but I drank greedily of a pure,
cool spring, that trickled down a chasm in the rocks, and
then thought of looking about for the nearest habitation,
I cared not whether it proved French or English; though I
had some dread of falling among the revolted slaves of
either nation, or the wild Caribs, the aborigines of the
Indian isles.
</p>

<p>
I found myself in a kind of creek, from which there was
no way of egress, but by climbing up the cliffs inland, as
the rocks descended sheer into the water, like ramparts of
basalt; so grasping the mangroves, the wild gourds, vines,
and other luxuriant creepers which covered the face of the
cliffs, I began to ascend from the shore.
</p>

<p>
I had scarcely attained an altitude of thirty yards or so,
when I found my feet entangled in what I conceived to be
the dried branches of a tree.  After kicking vigorously, on
looking down, imagine my sensations on finding that I had
hurled from a shelf of the rock the bleached remains of a
human skeleton!
</p>

<p>
This in no way cheerful episode, gave me fresh energy;
and I soon gained the summit of the cliff, which was about
a hundred and sixty feet high, and proved to be the most
lofty eminence in the isle&mdash;for it was an isle on which I
had been thrown.
</p>

<p>
Here I looked round, and must leave my friend the
reader to conceive the horror that survey caused within me.
On every side I beheld the girdling sea, but not a vestige
of a human habitation.  I was cast upon an island, about
twelve miles in circumference, desert, lonely, and though
fertile and densely wooded, uninhabited, save by the monkey
and the tortoise!  On this isle I soon discovered that I had
one companion&mdash;a terrible one&mdash;despair!
</p>

<p>
Some time elapsed, ere I could realize this terrible
conviction.  Desperately I toiled through the dense furzy
thickets, which were interwoven by tens of thousands of
jungly creepers, in the hope that some human creature&mdash;some
hermit, a shipwrecked wretch like myself&mdash;or lonely
Carib might meet me; but after a fruitless search, wasted,
worn, and hoarse with halloing, I returned to the summit
of the cliff, once more to survey the sea, in the hope of
beholding a sail.  Hunger as yet I did not experience; the
time for it was coming.
</p>

<p>
The noon of day arrived, and the heat and silence were
alike oppressive.  The fierce sun, hot, clear, and cloudless,
was at its zenith: the blue of the sky, amid which it shone,
was so deep, that the eye ached on surveying it, or seeking
to penetrate its far and wondrous immensity, while from
the still, calm, and waveless sea the smoky exhalations
arose in columns like thin white haze.  The heat was
suffocating; to breathe it, was like inhaling the atmosphere
of an open furnace.  One marvelled that the fiery orb
above failed to ignite the voiceless world below; and then
there was a silence so solemn in the sea and sky!
Everything was hushed, and amid the density of the primeval
thickets, the leaves of which hung parched and still, there
seemed to be not the smallest insect stirring.  Around me
there reigned that which a writer has styled, "The dead
silence of mid-day, which is deeper and more solemn in
tropical climes, than the deepest silence of night."
</p>

<p>
The whole day passed and evening found me still on the
cliff, sweeping the horizon with anxious and aching, keen
and haggard eyes; but not a sail appeared in sight.
</p>

<p>
I imagined that I must have been cast upon an islet
somewhere between the Windward Islands and those of the
Spanish Main; and such, ultimately proved to be the case;
for this new scene of my adventures lay about 63° 40' west
longitude, and 11° 40' north latitude, and is now known
as the Isle of Tortoises; so that our unfortunate ship
must have been driven at tremendous speed before the wind
and waves.
</p>

<p>
Guadaloupe! oh, how I longed to be with my comrades
now!  I envied even the youngest drum-boy in the Fusiliers.
</p>

<p>
Ever before me were the familiar features of my friends,
with those of poor Stanley, and other ill-fated men, who
had perished in the ship.  It seemed incredible that all this
had passed in a night.
</p>

<p>
Evening came on.  From the lonely cliff I still gazed
upon the lonelier sea.  The rays of the setting sun gave it
the aspect of a mighty sheet of flame, palpitating, rippling,
and reflecting every hue of the sky above.
</p>

<p>
And night was wondrous!  The deep calm sea reflected
the unnumbered stars so distinctly round the isle, that it
seemed to float between two heavens&mdash;one above it, and the
other below.  The night was passed in restlessness and
anxiety, or in dreams&mdash;uneasy visions; yet I know not that
I slept.  I had ample time for reflection now, on my own
conduct at various times.  I often prayed deeply and
fervently; but with the knowledge that if I were once out of
this confounded island, I would&mdash;I very much feared&mdash;be no
better than before.  Yet, it did not seem to me, that I had
been a very bad sort of fellow after all.
</p>

<p>
I might live to be an old man, if food such as I could
catch or glean lasted; but what a life would it be?  The
very thought was all but madness!
</p>

<p>
I might become ailing&mdash;seriously ill, and dying, lie
unburied with my bones whitening for years ere some friendly
hand interred them&mdash;if they were ever interred at all.
Then I remembered the skeleton that lay below the cliff,
and wondered what terrible tale of sorrow, suffering, or
crime, it would reveal.
</p>

<p>
I had read of the bones of wrecked or marooned men
being found, years after their death, upon the sandy banks
and desert rocks of the Antilles.  I had also read of white
mummies being found on the African coast&mdash;the mummies
of wrecked seamen, lying dry, shrivelled, and unburied on
the hot sands, and as these recollections occurred to me, a
gloomy horror of my situation settled over me, as each long
and lonely night drew solemnly and drearily on.
</p>

<p>
I felt all the bitterness of ambition nipped in the bud,
and of a future perhaps annihilated.  This was not the
lonely and miserable life, the lingering and awfully obscure
death, I had portrayed to myself in moments of boyish
enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
The next day came, and I awoke to find that I had actually
been asleep, and that day passed, as many were fated to
pass, without a sail being seen..
</p>

<p>
I gathered dried drift wood and fallen branches in a pile
on the summit of the cliff, to light therewith a signal fire
in case a ship should appear, without reflecting that I was
without the means of igniting the fuel; and on remembering
this, I could have wept with disappointment.
</p>

<p>
Thirst I could quench at every spring; but the pangs of
hunger now assailed me, and for a time death by starvation
stared me in the face.  I reasoned with myself, and after a
time took heart to look once more about me.  On examination
I found plenty of shell-fish on the shore; plenty of
land-crabs, fruit, yams, gourds, nuts; and thus, if by any
means I could have lighted a fire to broil one or other, to
dispel the dews of night, and be a seaward signal while it
lasted, I should not have fared so ill.
</p>

<p>
Tidings of the loss of the <i>Etna</i> would (I knew) ere long,
reach my mother and the regiment.  By the former I would
long be mourned for as dead; in the other, my commission
would be gifted away to another, on my being superseded;
but these reflections were almost trifling when compared to
others excited by my terrible predicament.
</p>

<p>
I had thirty guineas in my purse.  I often surveyed them
with a species of grim contempt.  In that sequestered place,
they were of less value than the wild vines that grew upon
the rocks, the giant land-crabs or the brown tortoise that
crawled upon the shore, and I would have given them all
for a flint and steel.
</p>

<p>
On the southern side of the island, there was a large
cavern, into which the sea rolled with a hollow sound; but
its aspect was so gloomy, that I had not yet curiosity to
penetrate its recesses.  Moreover, I had conceived a
horror&mdash;a hatred of this small spot of earth on which my evil
fortune had cast me.
</p>

<p>
How solitary were my days!  How deeply solemn&mdash;almost
terrible, were my nights on that lonely isle!  The
rising and the setting of the sun and stars alone marked how
time passed.
</p>

<p>
"Time, where man lives not&mdash;what is it but eternity?"
and thereon no man dwelt save me.  Means of escape I had
none.  There were no trees large enough to form a canoe;
and if they had existed, I was without tools.  Even with
a well-equipped boat, what could I have done?  In my
total ignorance of the locality and of seamanship, I was
safer on the island than on the sea; and these convictions
deepened the weariness and despair that sunk at times
upon me.
</p>

<p>
Every morning I watched the beams of the sun gilding the
peak of a lofty rock, ere he rose from the sea; they stole down
inch by inch, and foot by foot, as the god of day ascended into
the sky, till the waves at its base glittered in light.  At eve,
these waves were the first that grew dark; then the light
stole slowly upward, as the cold shade of night ascended
like a rising tide, till the last farewell ray of the already set
sun beamed on the sharp volcanic peak, and again the lonely
isle "was left to darkness and to me."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER LIII.
<br><br>
THE TREASURE SHIP.
</h3>

<p>
Necessity compelled me to invent certain means for the
sustenance of life, and for the preservation of health; for I
was daily in hope of seeing some vessel appear, either bound
for the Spanish Main, or for the Bay of Honduras.  Seven
days stole away, yet not a topsail had appeared above the
horizon, and I was afraid almost to sleep, lest a vessel might
pass in the night.
</p>

<p>
The heavy dews so productive of fever and ague were my
chief dread.  For the first three nights I slept under a ledge
of impending rock.  On the fourth day I had found the
fragments of a boat upon the beach in a place where they were
almost hidden by the sprouting mangroves.  Of these
fragments I constructed a kind of hut, by covering them with
turf and plantain-leaves, and therein I burrowed cosily
enough at night, and secured myself from insects, reptiles,
and the devouring land-crabs.
</p>

<p>
Hither I dragged the topsail-yard, and, by repeatedly
striking the mountings and sling, which were of iron, with
a hard stone, I succeeded in producing sparks which ignited
the dead, dry leaves, and occasionally made a fire whereon to
broil a tortoise or roast a yam.  A sharp stone served me
for a knife when opening cocoanuts; the kernel was food&mdash;the
milk was drink.  I ate only to sustain nature, for my
heart was heavy, and hope grew faint as day after day rolled
on.
</p>

<p>
So strange is the effect of an overwrought imagination,
that amid the awful solitude by which I was surrounded, I
thrice imagined that I distinctly heard a <i>voice</i> calling my
<i>name</i>.
</p>

<p>
In troubled dreams, my mother's kind face and sweet
smile came before me, and I heard the merry voice of Lotty,
who used to sing as constantly as the blackbirds for whom
she spread crumbs every morning on her window-sill; and
then I awoke to find it but a vision, and that those who
loved me were far, far away.
</p>

<p>
On a part of the beach which shelved abruptly down
towards the sea, I found, half-buried among the rank
luxuriance of the place, a rusty cannon of antique form&mdash;some
relic, perhaps, of the buccaneers, as it seemed much more
than a hundred years old, and bore upon its breech, in
Spanish, "<i>La Lima</i>."
</p>

<p>
In another place I discovered a more solemn memorial of
mankind&mdash;a grave, with the remains of a mahogany cross at
its head.  Who lay interred there?  Had he, or she, been
earthed up in their last home by the survivor whose bones
were scattered on the cliff, which, perhaps, he was daily in
the habit of climbing to gaze on the silent sea for a passing
sail, even as I now daily climbed it, and gazed hopelessly?
This solitary grave gave me food for many mournful
reflections, and caused a hundred vague surmises.  Its solitude
seemed all the more awful in that voiceless isle of the
Caribean Sea, and&mdash;I scarce know why&mdash;but I always shunned
the place at night, lest I might see the dim outline of some
ancient Spanish mariner, with peaked beard and slashed
doublet, or of some grim buccaneer seated at the head of his
own grave.  Solitude and thought were fast making me
timid and superstitious.
</p>

<p>
The dawn of day always filled me with new hope, but the
fall of night with heart-broken wretchedness.
</p>

<p>
On a day of more than common beauty, I had grown weary
of surveying the ever lonely sea, and descended from the
cliff to the shore.  As the sun went westward, the water
assumed a deeper blue; the lower part of my island became
almost black in its depth of greenness; but the summits of
its rocks and tufted pines were tinted by a red glow
exceeding any effect a mortal pencil could produce.
</p>

<p>
Wandering listlessly on, I reached the cavern which, as
already mentioned, opened on the southern side of the isle.
The cool shade of this vast recess allured me on this day to
enter it.  There was something solemn and majestic in its
height and depth&mdash;its walls of rock, covered by luxuriant
creepers, and its roof, a perfect but natural arch, encrusted
with scoriae, blocks of quartz, and studded by crystals, the
result of volcanic fires, while long stalactites, white as
alabaster, hung from the basaltic ceiling like the crocketed
pendants of a Gothic cathedral.  A kind of natural path,
formed by a ledge of rock, afforded easy access far into this
cavern, and along this I proceeded.
</p>

<p>
The purity of the external atmosphere seemed to increase
the wonderful depth to which I saw the bases of the rocks,
the layers of coral and shells, the huge, slimy plants that
waved their solemn and fan-like leaves a hundred feet below
me; I could see the silver-scaled fishes that glanced and shot
in and out of sight, while my own face and figure were
reflected there as in a well&mdash;and a woeful aspect they
presented, my tangled hair, my length of beard, my forehead,
cheeks, and neck scorched to russet redness by the tropical
sun.
</p>

<p>
Further within the cavern there was a strong and rank
odour of mingled seaweed and rotten branches with the
fungi that drooped from the rocks into the water.
</p>

<p>
To this retreat I often came to eat my dinner of broiled
shell-fish and yams.  Once, while reclined listlessly against
the rocks, after my savage repast was over, and gazing
vacantly into the calm depth of the water that rippled far
away into the recesses of the cavern, suddenly a natural
feature, which I had hitherto conceived to be a mere mass
of weedy rock, seemed to assume a new form.
</p>

<p>
The upper portion of it was only three or four feet below
the water; but lay like an enormous boulder-stone, wedged
between the walls of the cavern.  I strained my eyes&mdash;could
I be deceived?  No&mdash;it was a ship&mdash;the hull of a large but
shattered ship, lying with its stern towards me, slightly
heeled over to port, and covered by a mass of seaweed that
waved in long green slimy leaves and tangles on every ripple
of the water!
</p>

<p>
Here was a startling discovery and episode in my lonely
hermit life.
</p>

<p>
I tore down and drew aside some of the thick mangroves
and creepers which fringed the mouth of the cavern, and
admitted more of the broad blaze of the noonday sunlight.
Then I could distinctly perceive the mouldered hull of a
vessel of some five hundred tons; but of a strange and
antique form.  High-prowed and square-pooped, her stern
and quarters bore still the remains of elaborate carving,
though the greater portion of her starboard side and most
of her timberheads, with all her gunnel, had disappeared,
either by the shock of the waves, when she had been thrown
by a tempest and the force of the sea into this strange place,
or by the gradual process of decay; but her stern-post and
six stern-windows were distinctly traceable.  I could see the
fish darting through them into the watery recesses of her
mouldering cabins.  I could see where one or two pieces of
cannon, an anchor, and other heavy masses of ironwork, had
sunk by their own weight to the bottom, through the soft
and spongy wood, which, by the length of time it had
lain in the water, was now reduced almost to a pulp.
</p>

<p>
This ship had evidently been lifted by some mighty wave
into the chasm and bulged there, and now all that remained
of her was covered by an entire coating of barnacles and
seaweed.
</p>

<p>
A silent, voiceless, mouldering wreck is an object that
excites melancholy thoughts at all times; but in the
situation in which I was then placed, there was something also
exciting and solemnizing in the discovery; and for a time I
forgot even to look for a passing ship in the new and strange
interest this old and weedy hull of antique form roused
within me.
</p>

<p>
I remembered the brass cannon which was lying on the
shore inscribed <i>La Lima</i>, and one or two guns that could be
seen lying on the layers of shells beside the wreck, were
exactly of the same form and size.
</p>

<p>
"<i>La Lima</i>?" I pondered; this was no doubt the name
of the ship, and, as if to corroborate my ideas, she was
evidently built in the old Spanish fashion, with those elaborate
carvings on her poop and quarters, which survived even the
times of Trafalgar and Cape St. Vincent.
</p>

<p>
I came hither day after day to gaze on this new object&mdash;new
at least to me; till its gaping stern-windows became
like the features of an old friend, and I loved to fancy the
story of the wreck&mdash;to people her deck and cabins with the
life which had once been instinct there; the Spaniards,
with their slashed doublets, their mantles, ruffs, and rapiers,
their long and solemn Don-Quixote-like visages; and then
the fury of the storm, amid which they and their ship had
perished&mdash;all perchance save the <i>two</i>&mdash;one whose grave I
had seen, and the other whose bones I had so inadvertently
scattered.
</p>

<p>
On the adjacent ledges of rock were several rings, bolts,
and shapeless pieces of iron, from which the wood had long
since decayed, and which were mere masses of rust.  Among
these I found a circular plate of brass, or some base metal,
which had evidently covered the tompion of a cannon.  The
substance of which it was composed had resisted the process
of decay, and a thick coat of verdigris encrusted it.  On
removing this, I discovered letters and a date; and by a
little industry traced&mdash;
</p>

<p class="t3">
"LA LIMA, 1647."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Sixteen hundred and forty seven!" I exclaimed, while
memory came to my aid.
</p>

<p>
In an old book, over which I had often pored when at
home in my mother's cottage&mdash;a book which was given to
me by little Amy Lee, and entitled "The Buccaneers of
America"*&mdash;I remembered to have read of a great ship of
Lima, which bore the name of that wealthy province of
Peru.  She had on board a vast treasure, subscribed by the
merchants of Mexico and Panama, for the use and service of
the unfortunate King Charles I., then at the close of his
futile struggle with Cromwell and the Scots.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* "The Buccaneers of America, written by Mr. Basil Ringrose,
Gent., and printed for William Crooke, at the Green Dragon, without
Temple Bar, 1684."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
This stately caravel was said to have been mounted with
seventy great and small brass guns, and to have had in
treasure thirty millions of dollars, or pieces of eight; but
after leaving the coast of Peru for England was never heard
of again.  One rumour said that she had been last seen, in
the bay of Manta, twenty miles south from the equator;
another that she had foundered on Los Ahorcados, two
solitary rocks which lie a few leagues from the shore of the
Spanish Main.  At all events, she perished when King
Charles was a captive in the castle of Carisbrooke, and the
gold she contained never reached him, or the cavaliers who
stood by his fallen fortunes.
</p>

<p>
Strange emotions of mingled joy and mortification filled
my mind, on conceiving that I had made this valuable
discovery&mdash;joy, that a vast treasure, such as that which filled
the hold of this old shattered ship, lay there in secret and
only known to me; and mortification, that if I perished on
this most desolate isle, my bones might lie unseen and
unknown for as many years as she had done.
</p>

<p>
If she was&mdash;as I doubted not&mdash;the <i>Lima</i> of the buccaneer
history, of what avail to me were all the millions of dollars
she contained, or which were strewed at the bottom of the
cave wherein she lay?  Twenty times that sum, had it been
mine, I would have given freely, joyfully, to be away from
the place of my involuntary captivity, on board the smallest
craft that ever sailed the sea.
</p>

<p>
In the miserable little wigwam&mdash;the veritable rabbit-burrow,
which I had constructed, I lay for hours that night,
thinking of the wreck of the great Spanish galleon, and
picturing the great iron-bound boxes of treasure that were
lying among the weedy ruins of her gaping timbers&mdash;treasure
existing there perhaps for me alone; and then I smiled
mournfully, and almost with surprise at myself, and disgust,
to find how, with hope, the demon of acquisitiveness began
to fill my heart with the glow of avarice; and even while
thus smiling I resolved, with dawn, to visit the scene of my
long-hidden treasure.

<h3>
CHAPTER LIV.
<br><br>
A SURPRISE.
</h3>

<p>
During the whole of the next day I toiled to form a species
of hook, from the iron sling of the topsail-yard, with which
I had been washed ashore&mdash;using a long flinty stone as a
hammer, and another as an anvil.  Then I conveyed this
impromptu engine (which I had lashed with a tough
creeper to the yard arm) along the shore towards the
cavern, where I intended to use it as a drag and lever.
</p>

<p>
On this evening, as if an adventure was about to be
achieved, I was struck (I know not why) by the wild,
rugged, and beautiful aspect of this lonely island.
</p>

<p>
About the cavern-mouth, the foreground of the view was
a rocky beach, on which the waves of the Caribean sea
were dashing in white foam, for the trade-wind blew freshly
from the east.  Outside, the breakers had that greenish-brown
tint, peculiar to the sea when near shoal water that
is full of tropical weeds.  Beyond, rose lofty crags and
rugged precipices, crowned by palm-trees, and cleft here
and there into deep passes and fissures.
</p>

<p>
The time was evening now; the sun had gone down
into the waste of waters, but had left behind the splendid
tints of a windy sunset still playing upon the ever-changing
masses of torn vapour that hovered about the quarter of
his declension.  On the other hand, the moon, (to use the
language of Ossian) "full as the round-orbed shield of
the Mighty," was rising, but obscured in masses of dark and
opaque cloud, behind which her cold white lustre was spread
over the sky, and glittered in sheets of silver on the rippling
sea below.
</p>

<p>
It was amid a strange and wild, though not uupleasing
combination of light and shade, sea and shore, moonrise and
sunset, that I sought the weird cavern where the old
weedy caravel lay; yet I felt something impelling me on&mdash;a
craving after activity and excitement&mdash;though I had a
horror of the loneliness around me.  All my strength was
required in handling the topsail-yard, with which I made
three or four vigorous thrusts at the side of the ancient
ship and tore away one or two pieces of mouldered plank,
covered with shells and barnacles.  At every stroke the
plash of the water echoed mournfully.
</p>

<p>
I was in the act of pausing a moment to recover breath,
when a loud voice close by me exclaimed,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Yoho, brother&mdash;avast heaving?"
</p>

<p>
"A voice&mdash;<i>a voice here</i>&mdash;in this hitherto silent solitude!"
was the question on my lips and in my heart.
</p>

<p>
Paralysed by actual terror, I remained as if rooted to the
spot, like Robinson Crusoe when he first saw the human footprint
in the sand of his island.  Then a chilly horror&mdash;a dread
of witnessing something supernatural in the cold twilight of
that vast ocean cavern, made the blood curdle in my heart,
for I was too much of a Scotchman to withstand the force of
such weird ideas.
</p>

<p>
I turned slowly in the direction from which the voice had
issued; but instead of beholding the ghastly spectre of an
ancient Spanish mariner, with a peaked beard terminating
his sombre visage, a steeple-crowned hat and long toledo&mdash;the
squat outline of a bulbous-shapen fiend in voluminous
trunk hose, or the grislier spirit of a murdered captive,
watching over the treasure, the tomb of which I was now
violating&mdash;instead, I say, of any of these, I encountered
only the extremely matter-of-fact face and sturdy form of a
well-whiskered, brown-visaged British sailor, clad in a
tarpaulin sou-wester, blue checked shirt, and pair of tarry
trousers; and who, strangely enough, was tied by the hands
and heels to the stump of a decayed tree, on which, as I
afterwards found, he had been asleep, when, full of my own
thoughts and purposes, I passed close by him.
</p>

<p>
"Avast heaving!" he repeated; "come, look sharp, whoever
you are, and cut and cast off these infernal lashings, for I
am as stiff as if I had been here these three hundred years."
</p>

<p>
The voice grew familiar to me, and on coming close to
him, I recognized an old&mdash;but certainly not much
valued&mdash;acquaintance.
</p>

<p>
"Dick Knuckleduster!" I exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"You know me&mdash;come! that's devilish odd," he bellowed
out.  "A red-coat&mdash;a soldier too.  What! d&mdash;n my precious
eyes, is it you, Captain Ellis&mdash;or what are you?" he
added with a scowl in his eye and a growl in his tone.
"Now in the name of the living jingo, how came <i>you</i> here?"
</p>

<p>
"A coincidence fortunate enough for you, I think," said
I, and my own voice, so long unused, sounded strangely in
my ears.  "How came <i>you</i> here?"
</p>

<p>
"Do you see that craft in the clear offing, bearing away
north and by east?"
</p>

<p>
"A ship!" I exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"Ay, a ship," he added, gnashing his teeth; "and may
she never lift tack or sheet till she and all her crew are
moored in the jaws of hell!"
</p>

<p>
On looking round, I saw plainly enough a large brig
bout twelve miles distant, bearing off under a full spread of
canvas, that shone white as snow in the full splendour of
the risen moon, which contested for precedence with the
fading light of sunset on the sea.
</p>

<p>
"She is a privateer, the <i>George Third</i>, of Bristol, carrying
sixteen 12-pounders and three hundred men.  Men do I
call them? d&mdash;n them for a gang of lubberly cowards to let
their grogswilling tyrant of a captain maroon a poor devil
here as he did me; and tied to a post too, without a chance
for life."
</p>

<p>
"For what did he do this?"
</p>

<p>
"Mutiny&mdash;or madness he called it."
</p>

<p>
"When did this happen?"
</p>

<p>
"This very morning."
</p>

<p>
"Heavens!" I exclaimed, stung with disappointment.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I would rather shout on the other place," said he;
"but what is the matter with you?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Heavens," I continued, without heeding him, "that
this ship&mdash;this means of escape and life should be so near
and I ignorant of it!"
</p>

<p>
"By the captain's orders (here he uttered another
tremendous malediction) I was landed, lashed to that elegant
stump, and left, as you saw me, just six hours ago; but cut
the rope if you have an atom of human charity about you,
my jolly land-crab, for my hands and arms are swollen
nigh to bursting, like the skin of a Jack Spaniard's
borrachio."
</p>

<p>
"It is all very well to say cut, but where shall I find a
knife?"
</p>

<p>
"At the lanyard&mdash;the rope-yarn round my neck."
</p>

<p>
With his clasped knife I set free this ruffian, whose
presence, in sooth to say, I hailed at first with satisfaction,
and whose voice was most welcome to my ear; for to this
pass had a longing for fellowship brought me.
</p>

<p>
"And you, messmate?" he asked gruffly.
</p>

<p>
"Our ship, the <i>Etna</i> prize, was wrecked here.  Driven
ashore with this spar, I have been living a hermit's life, like
Robinson Crusoe, for I scarcely know how many long and
dreary days and nights."
</p>

<p>
"Give me your fin&mdash;thunder and blazes!  Oh, for a
drop of old Tom or right Jamaica to splice the mainbrace
with?  What have you in your locker?"
</p>

<p>
"My locker?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; you know what I mean."
</p>

<p>
"Cold water that gurgles from the rock, drunk out of
your hand or a vine-leaf."
</p>

<p>
"Bah!  Father Adam's scuttle-butt would never do for
me; but may I go to sea with a parson's warrant, if we
don't find something better than that here."
</p>

<p>
"How?  I should be glad to find something stronger."
</p>

<p>
"There must be some toddy-trees on this island.  I'm
cold as an iceberg in Baffin's Bay; but how'soever, I can,
blow a cloud of 'bacca."
</p>

<p>
Revolting as the companionship of this wretch proved, in
some respects I was thankful, truly thankful for it in my
solitude, and almost forgot the revelations of crime I had
overheard when with him in the Sandridge beacon.
</p>

<p>
"Now, what have you got to eat here?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yams, cocoanuts, tortoises, and shell-fish."
</p>

<p>
"What! not a devilled drumstick, peppered and done to
a turn&mdash;a grilled kidney&mdash;cold fowl and sliced ham?  No
jolly salt junk, so hard and pickled that it might polish like
Honduras mahogany?  Excuse me, mister&mdash;never mind,
you're no officer here, you know, so we shall get on as
merrily as two Chatham Jews on a pay-day.  I was once
shipwrecked among the tattooed devils in the Marquesas
islands, when on a voyage in the Southern Pacific.  A regular
Irish hurricane capsized the ship, and down she went to old
Davy with all hands on board&mdash;all, at least, save myself and
five others, who got ashore in the jolly-boat.  Men eat their
wives in the Marquesas occasionally; it is a matrimonial
privilege, and rather economical.  I lived with a fellow who
more than once offered me a broiled rasher off his squaw,
and very well it smelt, I can tell you, when broiled at the
end of an old boat-hook, well seasoned with pimento, and
spread, sandwich fashion, on a slice of the bread-fruit."
</p>

<p>
Knuckleduster concluded his reminiscence by a torrent of
forcible invectives on the captain who had marooned him.
</p>

<p>
We rambled along the shore in the moonlight, and though
I suggested that two persons could afford each other
considerable support, situated as we were, and might achieve an
escape from the island, which <i>one</i> would find futile and
fatal, he lessened my hopes of relief by assuring me that the
Isle of Tortoises lay far out in the Caribean Sea, and quite
beyond the usual track of vessels bound either for the Bay
of Honduras or the Gulf of Venezuela; and so we might
remain there till our heads were white as winter frost, or
the bursting tufts on the cotton-tree, without being
discovered or relieved.  But this fate seemed so horrible, that
I could not realize a conviction of its possibility.
</p>

<p>
My new companion soon discovered a species of toddy-tree,
the distilled gum of which made him partially
intoxicated, and for many days afterwards he almost lived at
the root of it, sucking the twigs, or with his lips applied to
the bark, till he sank on the ground like a gorged leech.
Under the influence of this new liquor, he frequently sung,
shouted to imaginary ships, crouched and shrieked in the
grasp of fancied phantoms and tormentors, danced hornpipes
on the beach, swore fearfully, and interlarded his
conversation, and more particularly his ravings, with
recollections of past days of crime, and always ended by an
astounding malediction on the crew who had marooned
him.
</p>

<p>
The solitude of my island had thoroughly departed now.

<h3>
CHAPTER LV
<br><br>
WE VISIT THE "GALLEON."
</h3>

<p>
On the morning of the day after I had discovered him, he
suddenly said:
</p>

<p>
"Now, mister, what game were you up to, when you
were poking in that dark hole, with this old stick, last
night?"
</p>

<p>
"Stick," I reiterated, "I do not understand you."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I know you understand me well enough; I mean
this spar, which I can see by a squint to be a stout
topsail-yard."
</p>

<p>
I felt the necessity of being extremely reserved with such
a reckless companion&mdash;especially the possessor of a weapon
such as I was without&mdash;to wit, a long clasped knife; and so
replied, with some caution:
</p>

<p>
"I was merely amusing myself."
</p>

<p>
"Amusing yourself?" he reiterated insolently, while a
sudden gleam shot from his sinister eyes.  "You'll excuse
me, but I don't think there could be much amusement in
the matter; so cut adrift all your quarter-deck humbug,
and come to the point at once, my sojer officer."
</p>

<p>
"I am not in the habit of being addressed in this
manner," said I angrily.
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;I beg your pardon," he replied with a bow of mock
servility, which was inexpressibly provoking; but, in a
situation so terrible as ours, being willing to conciliate one
with whom it was not worth my while to quarrel, I
somewhat rashly said:
</p>

<p>
"Circumstanced as we are, perhaps it matters little
whether I tell you the truth or not; but I have discovered
a wreck there."
</p>

<p>
"A wreck in that hole?"
</p>

<p>
"The shattered hull of an ancient Spanish galleon."
</p>

<p>
"What! d&mdash;n my limbs!&mdash;a galleon&mdash;a regular Rio de
la Plata treasure-ship?" he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"I have every reason to believe so."
</p>

<p>
"How&mdash;why?"
</p>

<p>
I related all that I had read about the great ship of Lima,
and the corroborations I had discovered.  On the conclusion
of my surmises, Master Richard Knuckleduster uttered a series
of imprecations upon himself, by which he meant to illustrate
his own extreme astonishment and satisfaction, adding:
</p>

<p>
"Smite me, if it don't sound mighty like a galley yarn!
Thirty millions of dollars, say you, skipper, lying in that
hole?  I can't overtake the sum, nohow; but it will rig
our mainstays for life, and we may drink and smoke and die in
our hammocks yet.  But it is like what I have often heard.
These seas and shores are full of buried treasure and craft,
sunk in the days when the old buccaneers prowled after the
plate fleets.  Why, the very sharks have rings and doubloons
in their greedy bellies at times!"
</p>

<p>
We repaired to the scene of the wreck together, and with
frantic vigour Knuckleduster at once assaulted the old hull
with the end of the topsail-yard, and our united efforts
brought up huge pieces of old wood covered with shells and
white coral branches.  In one of these, after careful
investigation, I found two coins, which proved to be silver duros,
bearing the effigy of Philip IV of Spain.
</p>

<p>
Our operations, and the noise made by Knuckleduster,
"yo-heave-o-ing," scared the sea-birds from their nests in the
clefts of the rock, and they screamed and wheeled in and
out of the cavern, as if in anger at our intrusion, or
contempt of our efforts.
</p>

<p>
On beholding the two coins, Knuckleduster nearly went
mad with joy, and as I could too readily perceive, jealousy of
me.  He swore, whooped, and danced, and rushed to suck his
beloved toddy-tree, at the foot of which I found him lying
insensible, and then took the opportunity of appropriating to
myself the clasped knife, of which I felt such dread, for with
a companion so lawless by nature, so powerful in form, and
entrusted with such a secret, I now felt that my life was no
longer safe.
</p>

<p>
On recovering, Knuckleduster immediately missed his
knife, and after searching all his pockets, closely and
suspiciously questioned me on the subject of its disappearance.
I suggested that in some of his frantic gyrations round the
toddy-tree, he had dropped it among the dwarf mangroves
or long grass.  He was forced to content himself with this
surmise, and to relinquish all hope of recovering it, after a
long and of course fruitless search.
</p>

<p>
Evening came on, and brought with it the usual buzz of
countless insects; the red fire-flies began to glance about
under the branches, the tree-toads, as large as tortoises,
were croaking and squattering in the swamps.
</p>

<p>
As we sat together at the foot of the everlasting toddy-tree
(the juice of which he could not prevail upon me to
imbibe, lest it should stupefy me), we revolved innumerable
plans for making signals to ships by day or by night&mdash;for
sleeping and watching by turns on the summit of the high
cliff&mdash;for escaping from the island by a canoe, if we could
make it, and for returning to raise, break up, or explore, the
old Spanish wreck.  When these were all viewed over and
discussed, I pressed Knuckleduster to relate to me, how he
came to be marooned by the crew of a privateer, when I
had last seen him at Los Santos, a seaman on board of the
<i>Boyne</i> frigate.
</p>

<p>
After some delay, and not until he had sucked a score of
times at the intoxicating and manna-like distillations from
the tree, did he tell me the following story, the oaths and
imprecations with which he most freely interlarded it, being
alone omitted.

<h3>
CHAPTER LVI.
<br><br>
KNUCKLEDUSTER'S STORY.
</h3>

<p>
"I was first in the smuggling line, and many are the
good cargoes of Nantz and Geneva I have run ashore all
along the coast between Hartlepool and the Spurnhead, in
the bights and bays, clefts and creeks, known only to ourselves
and our friends on shore; till once, after a hard chase,
our sloop was sunk by a twelve-pound shot that took her
between wind and water, from a king's cutter, commanded
by old Cranky, who was then in the Preventive Service.
This was in Brellington Bay, off the coast of Yorkshire, and
down she went, with all her brandy-kegs, and what was
worse, all her hands aboard, at least, all except me; so I
was taken and condemned to serve seven years in a man-of-war.
</p>

<p>
"I deserted in the West Indies, and joined some lads of the
knife and pistol, who manned a long, low, sharply-prowed
polacca, that carried by turns at her gaff-peak the flag of
every nation on earth, and had a long brass eighteen pounder
amidships, that did some mischief, I can tell you, along the
shore of the Spanish Main.
</p>

<p>
"Tiring of that, I sewed a thousand doubloons, the general
stock of the crew, who were all drunk at the time, in the
waistband of my trowsers, and shoved off in a whale-boat,
on a dark night, when the polacca was creeping under easy
sail near the high headlands of Dominica, and worked my way
home on board of an old sugar-ship.  In England, between
Jews and girls about Portsmouth, my doubloons melted like
snow on the sea, and I was glad to take the keepership of
Sandridge Light, to save me from the press-gang.
</p>

<p>
"We had some rare doings in that lighthouse, for a night
seldom passed without stupid craft being lost; for, d'ye see,
the machinery of the lamps often went wrong&mdash;at least, so
we said&mdash;and the devilish lights went out, at the very time
they were most wanted.  Well, we were burned out of that,
as you know; and though I escaped to Compton Rennel,
Broken-nosed Bill and Mother Snatchblock, an old girl who
was very fond of me, were shrivelled up like a couple of
castanas on the hob of the galley fire.
</p>

<p>
"One night I found myself at Hull, entered as a foremast
man aboard of a Quebec timber-ship, when there rose an
outcry in the docks that press-gangs of the West-India
fleet were out, and that the gates were all guarded by
lobsters from the barracks.  You know all about that too,
for by you I was taken; and I may tell you plainly that
for many a day after that I vowed to be revenged for the
trick, though I suppose you only did your duty, my young
cockerel.  You know, also, how I was taken prisoner and
employed by that false devil of a French colonel at
Martinique, and all about his pretty little wife.
</p>

<p>
"Well, within a week after the storming of La Fleur
d'Epée, a smart French sloop that lay in the carenage of
Los Santos was taken by Sir George Grey, of the <i>Boyne</i>, to
use as a despatch-boat, and on board of her he sent the
gunner's mate, with four hands&mdash;of whom I was one&mdash;to
convey letters back to Martinique.
</p>

<p>
"The devil, who has always taken the greatest interest in
me, had surely the entire arrangement of this affair; for the
gunner's mate was the man, of all on board the fleet, whom I
hated most, for three times he had caught me borrowing his
rumbo, and had me triced up to the gangway for a dozen&mdash;three
dozen for three glasses of grog!  Once he missed a
purse, and as its alleged contents were found in my
hammock by the three fellows who were now shipped with me,
I received four dozen, well laid on with a pickled cat, and
fainted; but was well soused by buckets of salt water to
bring me round again; then I forfeited all pay and prize-money
for six months.  No sooner did the sloop put to sea,
than all these things came crowding into my memory, and
my mind was soon made up to skewer the gunner's mate
and his three men, to plunder the sloop, run her ashore on
the first land I came to, and then trust to Fortune and old
Davy for whatever might turn up next.
</p>

<p>
"Catch me under a commodore's broad pennant again,
thought I, if I can get this craft into my own hands, and
make a clean run for it!
</p>

<p>
"We bent new canvass on the sloop in the carenage, and
passed through the Rade des Saintes just as the morning
gun was fired from La Fleur d'Epée and the union-jack went
up where the tricolour had come down a week before.  While
bending the canvass we had a carpenter's gang aboard from
the frigate, and from one of their chests I took the loan of
a fine sharp axe, made like an Indian tomahawk.  This I
hid in my belt, and buttoned my jacket over the blade.  We
had a fine run all day after leaving Los Santos; the wind
was not quite aft; but this all the better suited the trim of
a fore-and-aft rig like that of the cutter.
</p>

<p>
"Evening was closing, and already the Point Jacques of
Dominica was visible, and bearing a point or two on our
lee-bow.  We had the jib and staysail, the squaresail,
the fore-and-aft mainsail, and the gaff topsail set.  The
little cutter skimmed along like a flying-fish, and I had the
tiller, when the gunner's mate&mdash;who was a handsome young
fellow, by the way&mdash;came up from the cabin, and swore that
I was not keeping her full enough.
</p>

<p>
"I said something in reply&mdash;I don't know what&mdash;belike
it was 'Belay your jawing-tackle,' not being in a particularly
pleasant mood; but he snatched the coil of a rope off a
belaying-pin, cast a knot upon it, and laid it across my back
five or six times, saying,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'D&mdash;n you! you rebellious lubber; do you dare to
reply to me?  Look out, sir, or by &mdash;&mdash; I'll have you
keelhauled from the yardarm, to teach you to keep your eyes
open!'
</p>

<p>
"I knew that the gunner's mate was a tearing, swearing
fellow, who did his duty well, and valued no man a quid of
tobacco; so this time I did not reply; but I thought much,
and, slipping my right hand into the breast of my pea-jacket,
felt the sharp edge of my little hatchet, and whistled
with quiet satisfaction, while the gunner's mate, after giving
a glance aloft, descended into the cabin.
</p>

<p>
"On peeping through the skylight, I could see that he
was writing by the glimmer of a ship-lantern, and he often
paused to look at a portrait.  It represented an old lady&mdash;his
mother, as I afterwards learned.  He cut off a lock of
his hair with his clasped knife, and put it on the table, to
send home to the old Woman, no doubt.  At this moment
two of my messmates were below; the third was sitting in
the lee-bow, smoking quietly, so I lashed the helm with the
tiller-rope, and stole softly behind him.
</p>

<p>
"'Jack,' said I, 'do you think that <i>is</i> Point Jacques of
Dominica, for I have my doubts about it?'
</p>

<p>
"He started, and turning to me, asked if I was unwell,
and offered to take the helm, or ask a glass of grog for me;
there was something in my eyes or face which startled him,
and I <i>felt</i> that they had an expression scarcely human.  Yet
my tone and manner were calm and collected, though my
heart was raging like a hell within my breast.
</p>

<p>
"'Look!' I repeated; 'is that Point Jacques with the
sulphur mountain over it!'
</p>

<p>
"He turned his eyes towards the coast.
</p>

<p>
"At that moment I swung my axe aloft&mdash;it crashed into
the back part of his skull, and Jack fell prone with his face
upon the gunnel; I grasped the axe with my teeth, seized
him by the legs, and shot him over into the sea, where he
sank like a stone.
</p>

<p>
"This made some noise, however, and one of those below
put up his head inquiringly from the fore-hatch; just as he
did so, I rushed at him with a yell, and by one blow of the
axe cleft him to the nose!  He sank to the foot of the ladder
on the deck below.  On seeing this, his messmate, supposing
that the cutter was boarded by French or Caribs, came
rushing up with his cutlass, but I met him with one fell
swing of my weapon.  Missing his head, it fell on his
collar-bone; his sword-arm dropped; he sank against the combing
of the hatchway, and glared at me with a ghastly and
bewildered expression; but as he attempted to crawl on deck,
I soon despatched him by repeated blows&mdash;for now when I
saw blood, mine was boiling like liquid lava.
</p>

<p>
"With another yell of mad triumph I dragged his body
to leeward, shot it into the sea, and it vanished amidst the
white foam that smoked under the counter of the cutter, as
she flew from wave to wave.
</p>

<p>
(At this point of his dreadful narrative, Knuckleduster's
face glowed purple with excitement; his eyes glared like
two hot cinders; his thick coarse nostrils were dilated, and
he bit his swollen lips to repress the passionate triumph of
the infernal fury he seemed to feel again.)
</p>

<p>
"As he fell into the sea, my axe dropped with him.  If
the gunner's mate came up with cutlass or pistols, a death
as sudden as any I had bestowed would be my reward!  I
thought of dropping a cold shot on his head through the
skylight, forgetting for the moment that the cutter was
unarmed.  Then I caught up a handspike from the windlass,
and was rushing aft just as he stepped on deck.  The first
view he had of me, and the blood with which I was covered,
seemed to explain everything.  He glanced round for a
weapon, and then sprang forward, as full of confidence as a
frigate with a free sheet, and tried to grapple, barehanded,
with me; but retiring a pace or two, to give the handspike
full swing, I hurled it again and again on his head and
shoulders till he sank powerless and motionless at my feet.
Then I tore a ring from his finger, and a watch and purse
from his pocket, as being things that were of no use to him
or the fishes either; and as he was too heavy for me to lift,
I triced up the lee quarter-board, and shoved him through
it into the sea.
</p>

<p>
"Dead men tell no tales&mdash;and the fourth deed was done!
</p>

<p>
"I was alone in the cutter&mdash;alone on the sea!
</p>

<p>
"To be alone was to be independent; to be independent
was to be free.  I felt no compunction for what I had done;
these men were my enemies, and I could have slain them all
over again had the double deed been to do.
</p>

<p>
"I descended to the little cabin, where the lantern was
still burning.  On the table lay the letter which the gunner's
mate had been writing, and the ink was yet wet on it.  It
was to his old mother at Greenwich, saying all his back pay
and prize-money were lodged to her account in London; to
keep her heart easy and be jolly, as she would have him by
her side again, and as Sir John Jervis had promised him
promotion for his conduct at La Fleur d'Epée; that all he
could send home was a lock of hair for her and Emmy, and
a great deal more bosh of the same kind; so I laughed as
I read, and tore it to fritters.
</p>

<p>
"What! you groan, do you, Mr. Ellis?&mdash;groan like the
wind sighing through a lee scupper or the galley funnel!
Why, you swab of a sojer, we are both fighting men, only
that you fight for honour and humbug, I for plunder and
pay!
</p>

<p>
"In a locker I found a bottle of brandy, two case-bottles
of skiedam, and some wine; so I set to, and drank from
them all in succession&mdash;raw, with the jacket off, none of
your grog for me&mdash;till the whole cabin seemed full of cloven
heads, gashed faces, and gunner's mates; and then sinking
on the deck, I remembered no more of that night, or it may
be of the next day&mdash;or, for aught I know, of the next after
that.
</p>

<p>
"On recovering, I found myself in the dark, and half in
the water.  Thirst&mdash;thirst, as if the flames of that hot place
the parsons preach about were in my throat, and in my
lower spirit-room, assailed me.  I groped about for some
time without being able to comprehend my circumstances,
or where the deuce I was.  By the motion and sounds I
knew that I was on board some craft, and at sea; but <i>how</i>&mdash;for
her strange position puzzled me.  I groped about, half
gasping, the while for air, and, as I felt with my hands the
details of the woodwork around, gradually, but surely, a
horrible conviction came over me.  I was still in the cabin
of the sloop, but its position was <i>inverted</i>; the upper deck
was below me, and the lower deck above!  I was in mirk
darkness, and felt the water rising above my knees.  There
was a sucking, gurgling sound with every heave of the sea;
but this could be easily accounted for by the air, which was
confined in the hull of the cutter, and had no means of
escape.
</p>

<p>
"I now understood the whole catastrophe!
</p>

<p>
"While I had been in a state of stupor, a breeze or squall,
mayhap the same squall that foundered your ship, had
arisen.  Left to herself, the cutter's sails had been thrown
aback, her main-boom had jibed; she had been <i>capsized</i>,
and was now floating, keel upmost, in the sea; floating,
I knew not where, with me imprisoned helplessly and
dying of hunger, thirst, terror, and suffocation, (but I
cannot add remorse,) in her dark, inverted, and waterlogged
cabin!
</p>

<p>
"I felt the fishes, cold and slimy, darting about and
touching me.  What, if a shark, even of the smallest size,
found its way <i>up</i> the companion hatch into my dreadful
floating tomb!  The idea nearly drove me mad.  Amidst
water which I dared not drink, I endured the most maddening
thirst, and envied the dead body of my second victim,
which, or shall I say <i>whom</i>, I supposed to be floating in the
forehold.
</p>

<p>
"How long I had been in this wretched condition there
were no means of determining, neither could I distinguish
day from night.  I searched about for the bottles that were
left on the cabin table, resolving to drink myself into a
state of stupefaction, from which I might never wake more;
but sought in vain.  I found the locker like everything else,
<i>inverted</i>, and, of course, empty.
</p>

<p>
"My thirst was an overwhelming agony; moreover, I
endured great cold; my limbs were cramped, and hideous
faces, smeared with blood, winked their goggle eyes and
grinned at me, amid the dense obscurity which was almost
palpable.
</p>

<p>
"At times it seemed as if the capsized cutter sank deeper
in the water; and on these occasions I dared neither move,
breathe, or think; for though I had recklessly slain others,
I was haunted by an awful dread of dying there.
</p>

<p>
"Once I thought that the jaws of a huge shark yawned
beside me, and in a paroxysm of terror, I swooned, as they
seemed to engulf me.
</p>

<p>
"On recovering, some time after, half-choked and
half-drowned, I started up with a howl of despair, and beat
madly against the cabin wall with my clenched hands, till
they were covered with blood and bruises.  Was I deceived,
or was it reality?  A sound outside seemed to reply.
</p>

<p>
"I heard a kind of grating noise without, and then the
blows of some instrument&mdash;an axe or hammer&mdash;rang again
and again like thunder in my excited ears.
</p>

<p>
"The blows were redoubled, and I continued to knock
and to shout.  At last a plank of the inner sheathing was
started in the side of one of the starboard berths, and a
vivid stream of light burst blindingly into the darkness
around me.  Springing to it, I thrust up my head and
found alongside a boat full of men, who had seen the
capsized cutter from their vessel, and had come off to
reconnoitre.  They had fortunately heard me shouting or
hammering in my prison, and by means of a hatchet
proceeded to investigate the cause of this noise.
</p>

<p>
"They drew me out, and then judge of my horror, when
the first man whose eyes encountered mine, was the gunner's
mate, sitting pale as death in the stern-sheets of the boat
with the tiller-ropes in his hands.
</p>

<p>
"On beholding him, I tried to leap into the sea, but was
seized and lashed to the boat-thwarts by a rope, and while
the foundered cutter, on the air escaping as if with a heavy
sigh, from her cabin, filled and sank out of sight, I was
conveyed on board the vessel of my deliverers.  She proved to
be the <i>George Third</i> of Bristol a privateer brig armed with
sixteen 12-pounders, and her crew had picked up the gunner's
mate a quarter of an hour after I had chucked him overboard,
stunned but <i>not</i> killed.
</p>

<p>
"I knew that my life was not worth a tester now unless
I played a desperate game, and I played it well; for I
performed so many pranks, that conceiving they were
produced by insanity and remorse, instead of reeving me up to
the foreyard-arm as the gunner's mate urged, the privateersmen
marooned me on the first land they came to, my old
enemy only obtaining leave to bind me well to the stump at
which you found me; and now, as I am thirsty after this
precious yarn of blood and desperation&mdash;this long talkee-talkee
as the niggers call it&mdash;I shall have one more suck at
my old toddy-tree, and then turn into my hole for the
night."
</p>

<p>
Such was the bare narrative of crime related to me by
Knuckleduster.  He was certainly a pleasant companion to
have on that lonely island, and I had no reason to doubt the
veracity of his atrocious revelations, for he was too inebriated
to invent&mdash;if he had the power of invention&mdash;and situated
as we were, on that wild Caribean isle, he cared nothing
for me or my opinion of him.

<h3>
CHAPTER LVII.
<br><br>
A SAIL IN SIGHT!
</h3>

<p>
I had been more than a month and a half in my solitude
when the time of my deliverance drew near.
</p>

<p>
Miserable though my situation had been when alone on
the island, on consideration I believed myself more
comfortable than with such a companion.  His aspect now
annoyed, his conversation disgusted, and his bearing at
times enraged me.
</p>

<p>
I remember him telling me of a mutinous seaman,
who had been marooned by pirates on a lonely island in the
great Gulf of Mexico.  There he lived for years, till hope
had died within him, till his hair became grey, and he had
long ceased to look for a passing ship.
</p>

<p>
One morning when gathering nuts and herbs for his
usual repast, he stumbled over a mound of earth&mdash;or
what appeared to be a grave&mdash;a newly-made grave; for the
mound was freshly heaped up.  He rushed breathlessly to
his look-out place on the highest eminence of his isle, and
swept the sea by an anxious and haggard glance.
</p>

<p>
No ship was visible upon its waters&mdash;no boat was near
the coast, and the Mexican isle was as solitary and voiceless,
as it had been for many long and weary years.
</p>

<p>
Full of strange thoughts and superstitious fears, he
returned to the grave or gathered heap upon the shore, and,
after long consideration, scraped the loose mould aside by
Lis hands, and there, about three feet below the surface, he
found the body of a young girl, of great beauty, clad in the
dress of the living, but interred without coffin or shroud.
Her face was covered only by her rich auburn hair, which
was in great profusion, and she had a gold wedding-ring
upon the usual finger of the left hand.
</p>

<p>
What terrible mystery was this! how had she been
brought there, and by whom interred?  The marooned
man never could discover either, but he sighed bitterly and
wept, as he covered up the grave of the beautiful unknown.
Her sad pale face haunted him from that hour by day and
by night, so that ultimately he became insane, and when
found by the crew of a vessel from Tortugas, bound for the
Bay of Honduras, he refused to leave the island, "and
perhaps is there still, for all that I know," added Knuckleduster,
most of whose stories were extremely the reverse of
lively.
</p>

<p>
Conceiving himself quite my equal&mdash;as we were beyond
the pale of all discipline&mdash;he behaved in such a manner at
times, that I felt inclined to knock him down; but prudently
restrained the impulse, as he was more powerfully-built,
and more matured in form and years than I, and was
also skilful in the art of "bruising," a science of which I
was totally ignorant.  If I spoke briefly or haughtily when
he bored or wearied me, he would retort by an oath, or
make such a reply as this&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Come, come! no quarter-deck airs here, my sojer officer.
I'll teach you that Jack is as good as his master, and better,
perhaps, for the matter o' that.  Oh ho; we are indignant
are we!  A little pot gets soon hot; but don't forget how I
ropesended you, when you were in the lighthouse, like
a young bear, with all your sorrows to come."
</p>

<p>
His whole thoughts ran on the sunken wreck; the idea
of leaving the island, without conveying in some manner its
hidden treasures with him, never left his avaricious mind
for a moment; and, ere long, I could perceive how jealously
he regarded me as the discoverer of the vessel, and
the partner or sharer of the secret of her character and
existence.  Often when awaking suddenly, in the alternate
watch, which we agreed to keep on the summit of the cliff,
I found him regarding&mdash;not the ocean, but me, with a
sinister and strange expression in his eyes, which made me
thankful for the foresight that led me to secure his <i>knife</i>,
which I constantly wore in my breast pocket.
</p>

<p>
For several days about this time, the wind blew a hurricane,
and I was not without hopes, that it might send some
vessel to our relief.
</p>

<p>
Innumerable trifles seemed to confirm my suspicions of
Knuckleduster, and to indicate the necessity of being
on my guard; while the tales of blood and piracy he
related with such perfect coolness and equanimity, haunted
me continually, and made me feel bitterly the humiliation
of sharing my solitude with a wretch so vile.
</p>

<p>
If dreams are meant to be the forerunners of events, or
to serve as warnings to us, I was not without them.
</p>

<p>
I remember falling asleep under a plantain-tree, on the
summit of the cliff, as we sat there together one afternoon,
on the look-out as usual.
</p>

<p>
I dreamt that he and I were taken off the island by a
ship; but the joy inspired by this release was considerably
lessened on my discovering that she was a pirate, and
manned by ruffians who were his friends and former
messmates.
</p>

<p>
As we bore away to sea, I saw them in close conversation;
I heard their ominous words, and saw their scowling eyes
fixed furtively on me, while Knuckleduster told them, that
I alone could reveal to the world, where the Spanish
treasure lay, and unanimously they resolved to throw me
overboard.  In vain did I struggle, intreat, offer bribes, and
promise to relinquish all interest in the sunken ship or her
millions of pieces of eight!  Strong hands were upon my
arms&mdash;and huge, bony fingers clutched my throat.  I was
hurried to the ship's side, and saw the white foam running
under the counter to leeward, as she swept along with a
spanking breeze upon her quarter.  And now, methought
that Knuckleduster, with a refinement of cruelty peculiarly
his own, ordered me to be sewn up in a hammock and buried
alive in the sea.
</p>

<p>
No sooner was this proposed, than amid brutal shouts and
jests it was done; my body was straightened, lashed, round
with a rope, tied up like a mummy, and while the pirate's
black flag, with its skull and cross-bones, was waved in
mockery over me, I saw two 32-pound shots taken
from the combing of a hatchway and tied to my heels.  I
shall never forget the agony of that fancied peril!  The
beads of perspiration were rolling from my brow.
</p>

<p>
A mock burial service was read over me.  I heard the
solemn words pronounced, which until the resurrection
consigned my body to the deep!
</p>

<p>
A dozen of hands now seized the grating whereon I lay,
to cast me overboard to leeward, when the report of a cannon,
which the pirates fired as a signal, made me bound from the
turf on which I had been sleeping.
</p>

<p>
I was now awake&mdash;quite awake on the green turf; but as
if to continue the dream and perpetuate its agony, I heard
distinctly, at the instant of endeavouring to rise, the boom
of a <i>real cannon</i> tingling in my ears, and felt the hard coarse
hand of Knuckleduster on my throat&mdash;his knee upon my
chest, and saw his fierce and murderous eyes glaring into
mine, like those of a cobra capello.
</p>

<p>
A ship was off the coast, and now the double time of
deliverance, or of death, was at hand!
</p>

<p>
During my sleep and my terrible dream, this ship had
been approaching, and, as the wretch, my companion, watched
her, he resolved to silence me for ever, that I might neither
reveal his crimes or the secret of the sunken galleon to
others, and having no weapon, had resorted to strangulation
by the savage strength of two powerful hands and arms.
</p>

<p>
The bewilderment caused by my recent dream was still
upon me, and rendered my resistance feeble at first.
Already he had clutched all that remained of my tattered
neckcloth, and given it a fierce wrench by his muscular
right hand; then, when my head was turned round by the
agony of this compression, as if to increase the bitterness of
dying helplessly at the mercy of such a wretch, I could
see from the summit of the cliff, about four miles off on the
blue evening waters, a large frigate under a full spread of
canvas, approaching the island.
</p>

<p>
To perish thus in sight of relief&mdash;to be destroyed as it
were, on the threshold of home&mdash;after all I had endured,
endued me, though little more than a lad, with an unnatural
strength; thus I struggled wildly and madly, but bravely,
with my would-be assassin.
</p>

<p>
Unlike my bearing in my recent dream, I neither
entreated, threatened, nor promised secrecy, or mercy; but
summoned every energy to defend and preserve my life!
Raising me by the throat, he strove to dash my head upon
the earth to stun me; but in attempting this, he
over-balanced himself, fell, and in a moment I was above him!
</p>

<p>
He kicked, wrestled, bit, and howled like a fierce animal,
as we rolled together down the back of the cliff out of sight
of the coming ship, and there the wild shrubbery among
which we floundered pell-mell, separated us; but after
breathing for a moment, we arose and approached each other
to grapple again, and, as it proved, on the giddy verge of a
deep chasm in the rocks&mdash;a rent by which, in some stern
throe of Nature, this tall cliff had been split from its
summit to its base below the waters of the sea.
</p>

<p>
If the partial strangulation had enfeebled me, the blows
and buffets under which I smarted&mdash;the love of life, and
above all, my anxiety to make some signal to the nearing
ship, lest she might alter her course and bear away, endued
me with a courage and determination of which my ignoble
enemy was altogether destitute.  He could steal upon me
when asleep, but I could perceive that he now shrank from
the expression of honest defiance and resolution that flashed
in my eyes and glowed in my face.
</p>

<p>
We grasped each other!
</p>

<p>
Not a word was spoken, and no sound was heard, but our
suppressed breathing.
</p>

<p>
We were near the verge of the chasm, and more than
ever was the struggle now for life or death!  By sudden
jerks; by bending backward and thrusting forward, he strove
to place me between it and himself, with the intention of
tossing me into its black and terrible depth; but I grasped
him with a death-clutch, resolving that if it came to such
an issue, we should perish together.
</p>

<p>
The struggle was frightful; but it was too much for me,
as his strength overmatched mine.
</p>

<p>
I felt the failing of my powers, and my heart grew sick,
though the imminence of my danger caused me to make
efforts against him, which I now consider superhuman.
</p>

<p>
He rapidly forced me backward; and now he began to
shout and laugh, for only three yards of thick and furzelike
herbage lay between us and eternity.  He was gathering all
his vast strength for one decided effort, when a decayed
gourd was crushed to pulp under his right foot&mdash;he slipped,
and fell forward with violence towards the chasm, while I
rolled in the <i>other</i> direction; and before I arose, he had
uttered a wild shriek, and vanished!
</p>

<p>
For a moment, I could scarcely realize the truth; but
found that he had fallen <i>through</i> the luxuriant fringe of
creeping plants, wild vines, and yellow gourds which hung
over the brow of the chasm; but having caught a tough
vine tendril or branch in his descent, he swung by it over
the black profundity, clinging with seamanlike tenacity by
both hands, and uttering the most piteous cries for mercy,
or for that succour which I was totally unable to render,
even had I been disposed to do so.
</p>

<p>
Cautiously I drew near and surveyed him.
</p>

<p>
The chasm was about twenty feet wide.  Its walls descended
sheer into profound obscurity below, for a hundred
feet and more&mdash;perhaps, for aught man can learn, into the
bowels of the earth.
</p>

<p>
About five feet from the side on which I stood, the
wretched Knuckleduster swung by the vine-branch, which
he clutched as tenaciously as before he had clutched me,
with his felon hands.  His face was alternately pale as
death, or flushed with crimson, as the blood rushed
backward from heart to head.
</p>

<p>
My face and mouth were covered with blood; my limbs
ached with bruises; my throat had been compressed in that
ruffianly struggle to the verge of suffocation: thus my heart
boiled with rage; I was pitiless as a tiger, and heard his
entreaties&mdash;his offers to be my slave for life, with loathing
and with laughter; but they ended in a howl of mingled
fury and despair, when I drew from my breast-pocket <i>his</i>
large clasped knife, and opened it with grim deliberation.
</p>

<p>
"Abandoned wretch, the odds are now in my favour,"
said I; "you are helpless&mdash;I have no power to save you,
even if I would; but I may hasten the fast-running sands
of your evil life.  The time has come when you must taste
of that bitterness you have so freely dealt out to others&mdash;the
bitterness of death!  So, villain, receive the fate you
were about to accord to me!"
</p>

<p>
At these words I slashed the sharp knife across the tough
tendril of the gourd-vine.  It parted, and Knuckleduster at
once vanished into the awful profundity below, and with the
scream of a despairing spirit.  To what depth he fell, I
know not, for no sound followed his disappearance.
</p>

<p>
My hair seemed to bristle up, and heavily the hot
bead-drops rolled over my brow!
</p>

<p>
I thanked Heaven for my narrow escape&mdash;for the retribution
thus placed in my hands, and turned away with little
more regret than if I had dealt a finishing blow to an
expiring reptile.  I had already fought my way over too many
slain heaps of good and gallant hearts, for the impression
made upon me by the fate of this man&mdash;or the mode in
which I had hastened it&mdash;to be very lasting or very
profound.
</p>

<p>
Hurrying to the summit of the cliff on which he had
assaulted me, breathless lest I should be too late to signal
the ship whose appearance had caused this conflict and
unforeseen catastrophe, I looked around for her in an agony
of suspense.

<h3>
CHAPTER LVIII.
<br><br>
SAVED!
</h3>

<p>
A large double-banked frigate was now shortening sail
about a mile from the coast, and a boat left her side as the
mainyards were backed, and the courses hauled up.  Thus,
I believed she was merely shortening sail, to permit a party
of explorers to visit the island, and this surmise proved in
the sequel to be a correct one.
</p>

<p>
On looking again, as she swung round, and the sunshine
fell full upon her shivering maintopsail, I recognized a patch
made in the sail where a ball from Fort Royal had pierced
it, and by this mark knew her to be my old friend and
habitation, the <i>Adder</i>.
</p>

<p>
The boat was soon midway between her and the beach;
the bright blades of its sixteen oars were flashing like silver
in the sunlight, as it sped along the rippling waves.
</p>

<p>
Such was the double emotion caused by the effect of my
recent fierce excitement, and joy at the prospect of release
from my miserable seclusion, that my limbs trembled with
feebleness, and my eyes were so full of tears, that I could
scarcely descend the cliffs to meet the crew, and was without
voice to hail them, as they ran their boat into a little creek,
laying in the oars in true man-o'-war fashion; and then a
number of young officers, bent on a "lark" or ramble about
the island, sprang ashore with boisterous glee and laughter,
and all armed with ship-muskets or fowling-pieces.
</p>

<p>
At last I gathered strength to utter a shout that seemed
to come from my inner heart, while descending a wooded
bank to the beach, where the recently-landed group stood
gazing at me with astonishment expressed in all their
faces.
</p>

<p>
Though the tattered remains of my uniform, my uncombed
hair and shaggy beard, were somewhat fantastic, my
aspect was too wild, haggard, wasted, and forlorn, to excite
laughter, while hurrying toward them.
</p>

<p>
"Now, in the name of old Davy, who, or what are you?"
asked one, whom I knew to be the first-lieutenant of the
<i>Adder</i>.
</p>

<p>
"One who has the pleasure of knowing you well enough,
Mr. Percival," said I, stretching out my hands to him.
</p>

<p>
"This is a deuced queer rencontre! are you sailor
or soldier, Carib or what?"
</p>

<p>
"Come, come, Percival; surely I am not so altered as to
be taken for a Carib, though I have lived like one for many
a day.  Thanks be to Providence, you have come to my
rescue!  Cannot you remember me&mdash;Ellis of the Scots
Fusiliers&mdash;Lieutenant Ellis, who sailed from Guadaloupe
and Los Santos in the prize privateer <i>Etna</i> on a special
duty?"
</p>

<p>
"With Ned Stanley&mdash;remember you, my dear fellow, of
course!" said he, grasping his hand, as his companions, now
assured that I was neither a satyr, an Orson, a Casper Hauser,
or likely to <i>eat them</i>, came round me; and the joy I felt on
hearing their voices, and seeing their open, honest, and
weatherbeaten English faces, was so great in my swelling
heart, that it almost amounted to pain.
</p>

<p>
"How came this about&mdash;that we find you here and
alone?" asked Percival.
</p>

<p>
"We encountered a hurricane&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ah&mdash;whereabout?"
</p>

<p>
"Off the isle of Avis, or the tail of the Avis Bank&mdash;the
ship foundered&mdash;capsized and went down."
</p>

<p>
"With all hands on board?"
</p>

<p>
"All, French passengers and every one."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind the French," said one, "but poor Ned
Stanley&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"He was swept off the maintopsail-yard, when the mast
was lying horizontally in the water, and so was drowned
with four others who clung to it."
</p>

<p>
"And you&mdash;&mdash;" they inquired with one voice.
</p>

<p>
"After long drifting in the sea, and being driven hither
and thither by waves and wind, I was washed ashore with
a spare mizentopsail-yard, and have lived here like
Robinson Crusoe ever since."
</p>

<p>
"A strange story!" said one.
</p>

<p>
"It is deuced fortunate for you," said Mr. Percival, "that
during the last day or two, the gale was so stiff that we
were driven thus far out of our intended course.  Having
sighted this island by our glasses, a few of us came off to
have a lark with the Carib girls, if there were any, and a
shot at the monkeys, or anything else that might turn up."
</p>

<p>
"Were you cruising?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, in search of any French craft we might find; but
there is not a tricolour pennant to be seen in these waters,
so to-night we haul up for Guadaloupe again."
</p>

<p>
"What are the news from that quarter?"
</p>

<p>
"Bad enough," replied several shaking their heads.
</p>

<p>
"How&mdash;the yellow fever, I suppose, has broken out
among the troops?"
</p>

<p>
"We have not wanted for that either," replied Percival,
"but the French have retaken La Fleur d'Epée, and played
the devil with your 43rd Regiment; however, you shall hear
all about this after.  Meantime, a meal such as befits a
Christian, and a glass of good wine, will not be unacceptable
I presume, so come off to the frigate at once.  Gentlemen,"
he continued, addressing his party, "you can remain ashore,
while I take Mr. Ellis off to the ship&mdash;but remember to
assemble here the moment she fires a gun or displays her
ensign."
</p>

<p>
He kindly assisted me into the boat, and now my emotion
was such, that I almost sank down in the stern-sheets.
</p>

<p>
"In fenders&mdash;out oars," said he, assuming the tiller-rope;
"and now give way, lads&mdash;give way with a will!"
</p>

<p>
But the injunction was scarcely required.  In their
anxiety to place me on board, the brave fellows bent to
their oars with such vigour, that by every stroke the long,
sharp boat was actually lifted clean out of the water, and
we surged through it with the speed of a race-horse.  Then,
when again I found myself alongside the noble old frigate,
and saw her triced-up ports, with their tier of artillery
peering through them&mdash;her swelling "wooden wall," that
towered like a bastion from the water&mdash;her well-squared
yards and tapered masts, that towered away to the long
whiplike pennant that streamed on the wind&mdash;I say, when
seeing all this, and hearing the sounds of English voices, of
a fiddle and scraps of a song or two from the idlers between
decks&mdash;then, more than all, the soldierly aspect of the smart
marine sentinel on the poop in his red coat and well
pipe-clayed belts&mdash;I felt myself at <i>home</i> indeed, but with the fear
that all might prove another dream.
</p>

<p>
On computing dates, we found that I had been exactly
<i>one month and eighteen days</i> on the island.
</p>

<p>
Once away from it, my past existence there seemed really
like a dream, which I could scarcely recall.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER LIX.
<br><br>
CAPTAIN CRANKY.
</h3>

<p>
I was received with considerable kindness by Captain
Cranky, who, with all his roughness and tyranny, was not
without some redeeming points of character.  He conveyed
me at once to his cabin, furnished me with proper
refreshments, clothing, and with that which was of some
importance in the days when George III. was king,
shaving apparatus, for of all these items I was greatly in
need.
</p>

<p>
After living so long in the open air, I had a sensation of
oppression and suffocation in his cabin, and the combined
odours of the ship were also overpowering.  Afterwards,
when at lunch, the captain and Mr. Percival, heard the
relation of my adventures on the island, and detailed for
the information of Admiral Jervis my account of the loss
of the <i>Etna</i>.
</p>

<p>
I was then informed of the events which had taken
place at Guadaloupe in my absence.
</p>

<p>
The brave old General Dundas&mdash;that sturdy specimen of
a Scottish gentleman and soldier of the old school&mdash;had
died there of yellow fever, and my regiment, the
Fusiliers, had suffered considerably by that scourge of the
Antilles.
</p>

<p>
The general was scarcely interred, when a French expedition
consisting of several sail of the line, with frigates
armed <i>en flute</i>, and transports with two thousand troops on
board, had suddenly arrived and assailed fort La Fleur d'Epée.
Landing in thirteen boats, they stormed the works, after a
hard struggle driving out our 43rd light infantry, under
Colonel Drummond, who, finding his strength reduced to
only <i>one hundred and fifty</i> rank and file, abandoned the
place, and embarking them in two large boats, set sail for
Basse Terre, leaving the foe in possession of one half of the
island, which is divided in two by a narrow channel.  The
French in following them up, had nearly captured the Earl
of Kildonan and his young countess, who had arrived from
Britain, and both of whom had been on a visit to Colonel
Drummond, when La Fleur d'Epée was so unexpectedly
attacked and retaken.  In crossing the Riviere Salee the
two boats were exposed to a fire of grape from the French
galloper guns, and the countess had her dress torn by the
balls, and her face covered by the blood of a corporal who
was killed by her side.
</p>

<p>
All this had occurred on the 5th of June, and Sir Charles
Grey was now taking measures to drive these temporary
victors into the sea.
</p>

<p>
"We shall haul up for Guadaloupe to night," said Captain
Cranky, "and rejoin old Jack Jervis&mdash;for we know there
were at least nine large ships in the squadron which retook
the fort, and I would not, for a thousand guineas, miss the
chance of overhauling the parleyvoos, d&mdash;n them!  Take
some more wine, my good fellow, or would you prefer grog?
D&mdash;n my eyes! to think of living on greens and cold water
for nearly two months.  I consider our ship-biscuits bad
enough, when full of these maggots and weevils that
whirlwind Tom&mdash;'tis a name we have for the devil aboard
ship&mdash;is always putting into them; but sink me! even a week on
that island&mdash;a week of banyan days, would have been the
death of old Tom Cranky."
</p>

<p>
While the captain ran on thus, and forced me to drink
glass after glass of wine, I could scarcely repress a smile, on
remembering the terror I had of him when on board the
Leith pressing-tender.
</p>

<p>
As soon as the party came off from the island, which they
did with their boat laden with yams, tortoises, and fruit, we
set sail for Guadaloupe, and, to my surprise, my oldest friend
could not have exceeded Captain Cranky, in his continued
kindness and attention to me.
</p>

<p>
After the squadron left the West Indies, he served with
great distinction in the Mediterranean, and afterwards in
the Baltic.  When in the latter sea, with the combined
fleets of Britain and Russia, then under the command of
Admiral Viscount Duncan, a curious anecdote was related of
him, which was well known in those days.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Adder</i>, requiring to be refitted, was put into the
harbour of Memel, where the Emperor of Russia, the hapless
Paul I. (who was strangled in 1801) was then residing with
the King of Prussia, Frederick William II., as they were in
alliance with us against France.
</p>

<p>
It happened that the two monarchs, attended by a few
gentlemen, were walking along the mole to survey the new
fortifications, when they met Captain Thomas Cranky; and
his peculiar aspect, his battered visage, and old cocked hat,
his periwig, pea-jacket, and brass-hilted hanger, attracted
their attention.  Then Paul I., perceiving a Russian military
order dangling at his lapelle beside a boatswain's whistle,
which Cranky was never without, inquired politely when
he got it.
</p>

<p>
"Last year, for my services at the blockade of Ancona,"
replied Cranky briefly, and was moving on, as he hated all
foreigners with a hearty old English hatred, viewing them
as a Skye terrier does rats.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you served with the allied Russian, Turkish, and
British squadrons?" continued the emperor.
</p>

<p>
"Belay, you lubber, and overhaul your speech again; don't
name the British fleet <i>last</i>," said Cranky, totally ignorant of
whom he was addressing; but the Emperor Paul laughed
heartily.
</p>

<p>
"Take care, sir," said Frederick William, smiling; "you
are addressing His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of all the
Russias."
</p>

<p>
Confounded on hearing this, Cranky drew back, blushed
very red, and taking off his rusty cocked hat, made a
profound sea bow.
</p>

<p>
"And <i>this</i> gentleman," added the emperor, who was
very much amused, "is his Prussian Majesty, Frederick
William II."
</p>

<p>
On hearing this, Cranky conceived that they were
bantering him; so he stuck his cocked hat fiercely over his
solitary eye, and sputtered out,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'Vast, you lubbers!  I don't choose to be made game of
by you, or such as you,&mdash;so sheer off, or I'll trounce you
both, for insulting the captain of a British frigate!"
</p>

<p>
And so he swaggered off, with his left hand upon the
brass hilt of his old hanger.
</p>

<p>
Poor Tom Cranky has long since been at rest from his
labours by sea and land; but he lived long about
Greenwich, where he was a great authority upon all matters
pertaining to ships and salt water,&mdash;the lion of a little naval
club, and was wont to boast,&mdash;
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER LX.
<br><br>
THE YELLOW FEVER.
</h3>

<p>
The heat of the atmosphere was now so great, that one
might have imagined, as Cranky said, "that there was only
a sheet of paper between the <i>Adder's</i> cabin and <i>another</i>
place."
</p>

<p>
As the months of May, June, July, and August, are the
most fatal for the yellow fever, it now broke out on board;
the sick-bay was soon full; many officers were confined to
their cabins, and a day seldom passed without some one
being sent to his long home at the bottom of the great deep,
with a thirty-two pound shot at his heels; and ere long I
bade fair to become one of its victims.
</p>

<p>
The excitement so long and so recently undergone,&mdash;the
sudden change of food, raiment, and quarters, after the total
alteration of my system and habits, during the time that I
had lived like Nebuchadnezzar on the Isle of Tortoises.&mdash;now
began to tell fearfully upon me; and I was assailed by
that scourge of the Antilles, the yellow fever.  When the
conviction of this came over me, I had but one emotion,&mdash;devout
thankfulness that it had <i>not</i> fallen upon me while
lonely and desolate, helpless and friendless, on the island.
</p>

<p>
On the third day after we bore up for Guadaloupe, I was
seated at mess in the ward-room of the frigate, enjoying the
tempered atmosphere of the evening as it passed the open
ports, through which we could see the waves of the blue sea
as the <i>Adder</i> sped on, with the wind upon her quarter, when
first the symptoms of the dread pest assailed me; and from
all I knew of it, I made up my mind to prepare for the
worst.
</p>

<p>
A wine-glass dropped from my hand and shivered on the
deck, as the general premonition, a cold and violent fit of
shivering, came suddenly over me.  Then I remember
Percival, the first lieutenant, starting up, and exclaiming,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"The fever, by Jove!  Sentry, pass the word for the
doctor&mdash;quick, the yellow admiral is here!"
</p>

<p>
In ten minutes after I was undressed and in bed, ill with
the confirmed pestilence.  How long and weary were its
hours of agony, thirst, and lassitude, which followed that
fatal evening!
</p>

<p>
After the shivering fit, there usually succeeds a violent
fever, with acute pains in the head, back, and limbs; an
intense dejection of mind; an agonizing thirst, with a
tongue so dry, that it rattles in one's jaws like a kernel in
a shell; and then comes the frightful <i>yellowness</i> of
complexion, from which the fever takes its name.
</p>

<p>
Though I have seen some who, after it abated, became
cold as ice, and remained thus, with a tolerably sedate mind,
and expired after twelve hours or so,&mdash;others who died after
violent bleeding from the nose,&mdash;others who departed raving
mad,&mdash;in me it took the form of continued delirium, in
which, as I was afterwards told, I raved of the lonely island,
renewed my struggle with Knuckleduster, and nearly killed
a poor marine, who acted as my servant; then I laboured
to raise the wreck of a treasure-ship, and believed myself
again and again to be in a great cavern, till total
prostration of mind and body succeeded, and a long stupor came
over me.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
A sea-going frigate of the year 1794 was somewhat
different in many respects from a ship of similar rank in the
present age of rifled cannon and screw-propellers; and hence
the odours that came from the ship's stores, the bilge, the
sick-bay, and the cockpit, when a fierce West-Indian sun
was blazing overhead, making the pitch boil between the
planks of the main deck, were anything but consolatory or
refreshing to the unfortunates on whom the grim pestilence
had laid his yellow and shrivelled hand.
</p>

<p>
When awaking, as it were, from a long lethargy, I found
myself slung in a hammock near an open port, through
which the blessed breeze of Heaven, as it came over the
dancing waves, blew upon my wan and fevered cheek, and
refreshed me.
</p>

<p>
A marine, who had charge of me, now placed a pewter
flagon, filled with water-gruel, in my trembling hand.  I
drank thirstily, and then sank back with a sigh of mingled
weakness and satisfaction.  Youth made the elements of life
strong within me; and <i>hope</i> returned with consciousness,
though twice or thrice daily I saw a dark object fall heavily
and endlong past the open port&mdash;plash into the sunlit sea
and disappear!
</p>

<p>
Then would I close my eyes, and strive to pray, and to
remember some of the little lessons my mother taught in
purer and happier times; for these dark objects were the
bodies of my fellow-sufferers, who were thus consigned to the
waters from the deck above.
</p>

<p>
Ere long I was able to ask the marine whereabout we
were, and he said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"The isle of Nevis bears about ten miles distant on our
lee bow,&mdash;the top of the hill (for the island is only a great
conical hill) is in sight."
</p>

<p>
"Then how far are we from Guadaloupe?"
</p>

<p>
"Ten miles from Nevis, sir, will make us one hundred and
forty from Guadaloupe," replied my accurate informant.
</p>

<p>
As health returned, I longed for the shore, and for active
life.  The dull routine of days and nights of sickness
anywhere, soon palls upon the excited senses; but nowhere so
soon as in the narrow limits of a little cabin.  The sea is
certainly an everchanging and beautiful object; but when
the port-lid was closed, my eyes had nothing to rest on but
a 24-pound carronade slued alongside, and then it seemed as
if every avenue to nature was closed too.
</p>

<p>
I had nothing near or around me to give pleasure or suggest
pleasing thoughts; and then it is in such a mental and
bodily prison, that "the small still voice" comes home to
the heart and soul, and we seem to think, reflect, and feel,
all the more deeply and earnestly, because soul and heart are
both thrust back upon themselves.
</p>

<p>
The breeze which had hitherto been fair, now freshened
and blew right ahead; so we had to beat to windward
against it, and four days after, when becoming convalescent,
I heard the booming of the <i>Adder's</i> guns, as she saluted the
flag of Admiral Sir John Jervis, when, under a press of
canvas, we ran into the roadstead of Basse Terre, in the
island of Guadaloupe.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap61"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER LXI.
<br><br>
I REJOIN THE REGIMENT.
</h3>

<p>
I now experienced somewhat of that miraculous cure
which restored Bruce of ours to health, before we landed in
Martinique.  Excitement and pleasure at the prospect of
soon rejoining the regiment and seeing my old friends,
endued me with new strength; and in spite of all that
Captain Cranky, Percival, or their surgeon could urge, I
insisted on going on shore next day, and on shore I
accordingly went.
</p>

<p>
War and pestilence had made such havoc in my dear
old corps, that, on the 1st of July, only two days after my
landing, I found myself parading as captain of the third
company, vice Gordon of Ardgilion, who had been shot in
the first attempt to retake La Fleur d'Epée.
</p>

<p>
I was not yet twenty years of age!
</p>

<p>
Once again in Guadaloupe, the entire half of which was
possessed by the enemy, I had every prospect of seeing a
good deal of fighting; and the fire of ambition to which my
rapid success bent every impetus, glowed anew within me;
though somewhat tempered by the horrors of the yellow
fever, which thinned our ranks so fast that the bear-skin
caps of the poor Fusiliers lay thicker in the barrack-yard
and in the ditches of Basse Terre, than I had ever seen them
in action; till at last an order was issued to burn all the
gear of the dead.
</p>

<p>
I was not permitted to remain long idle, for while Sir
George Grey, the commander-in-chief, was preparing to
recapture Grande Terre, as one half of the isle is named,
I was detached with my company on a special service
against a body of armed slaves who were in revolt; and
while acting by turns as <i>Gens du Roi</i>, as French republican
citizens, and as men of colour struggling to erect a free
community, committed outrages too horrible for narration
upon the French planters, the white troops of Victor
Hugues, and all British soldiers who unfortunately fell
into their hands.
</p>

<p>
The regiment was on its morning parade in the ancient
citadel of Basse Terre, when the Earl of Kildonan rode to
the group of officers, who were gossiping and bantering each
other, in the usual way, before the bugle sounds "Fall in,"
and announced the duty which was before me.
</p>

<p>
"These rascals," said he, "are in arms in the mountains,
and are such a common nuisance to all, that Sir Charles
Grey has already conceived the idea of inviting the
co-operation of our enemies the French, for the extermination
of all revolted blacks."
</p>

<p>
"Who leads them?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Scipio, a leader of the revolted blacks in Hispaniola&mdash;the
same African savage who destroyed the family of
Monsieur du Plessis and abducted his daughter.  After
suffering, within a short but bloody month, many
reverses from the arms of the French colonists, he fled by
sea, and reaching Guadaloupe, has incited the slaves of a
wealthy planter, named Monsieur George de Thoisy, some
eight hundred in number, to revolt, and carry off their
master, whom they intend to put to a barbarous death; at
least, so I am informed by Lady Kildonan, who is residing
with his family.  Since then many mulattoes and quadroons
have joined him; thus his band musters nearly a thousand
strong."
</p>

<p>
"My lord, my company is barely a hundred rank and
file!" said I hesitatingly.
</p>

<p>
"But they are Scots Fusiliers, and those you are to attack
are only a band of wretched negroes.  As a sample how
they mean to carry on the war, the standard of our sable
hero with the classic name, is a white man's head upon a
pike."
</p>

<p>
"This is encouraging!" said I, laughing.
</p>

<p>
"I am glad you think so."
</p>

<p>
"And my orders are&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"To march at once, attack their fastness in the mountains,
and save M. de Thoisy if you can.  Root these fellows out,
and show no quarter, but take especial care that none of
your men fall into their hands, alive at least, if you can
prevent it."
</p>

<p>
"Are they worse than other folks?" asked Rowland Haystone.
</p>

<p>
"I should think so&mdash;they eat their prisoners."
</p>

<p>
"Eat them!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; after offering them up to an idol they have
fashioned out of the bones of white men."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Ellis, this is not a pleasant prospect for you after
being starved on that island for a month and more," said
Glendonwyn.
</p>

<p>
"And this rich old planter&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"They can't be particular to a shade, if they eat him,"
said Haystone, laughing.
</p>

<p>
"Why?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think the old fellow will prove very digestible."
</p>

<p>
"You remember his daughters, Georgette, Claire, and
Julie, three handsome girls, whom we met at the ball here
in Basse Terre, on the night before La Fleur d'Epée was
retaken," said Bruce.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied Haystone, twirling his whiskers (we were
not permitted a moustache in those days); "charming French
Creole demoiselles, with designs upon the liberty of mankind
equal to those of Bonaparte and all the Directory."
</p>

<p>
"They beat all the girls in the Antilles, windward and
leeward," said another, "and can flirt like the deuce."
</p>

<p>
"Ah&mdash;we understand all that," lisped our last accession
of a sub from the depôt; "but though we do make a little
love in the Fusiliers, we don't marry!"
</p>

<p>
"Do not jest thus, if you please, gentlemen," said Lord
Kildonan; "their father, poor man, must be saved, if possible.
He is, I believe, a loyal old French royalist, and is
now at the mercy of absolute devils incarnate.  So to you,
Ellis, I confide the duty of saving him.  March, and take
your whole company; but whatever you do, do warily, for
those black fellows are full of strategy and wickedness.  See
that your men keep sober, for kill-devil (new rum) slays
more than French bullets or the yellow fever.  Shoot all
who make the slightest resistance, or in fact, whom you find
in arms."
</p>

<p>
"And philanthropists at home?" queried Glendonwyn.
</p>

<p>
"Philanthropists at home, who run no danger, and sleep
sound in their beds at night, may say exactly what they
please.  With savages, one must act the savage.  Are we to
grant the courtesies of war and of civilization to those who
are ignorant alike of military honour and the amenities of
civilized life?  <i>Terror</i> is the only argument they
understand; so, through terror, bloodshed, and death, must we
speak to them.  To strike terror into mere cannibals is to
befriend them.  There sounds the bugle!  Gentlemen, to
your companies.  Ellis, good-bye; make quick work with
Scipio and his Quacos, or you may be too late to share in
the recapture of La Fleur d'Epée."
</p>

<p>
In ten minutes after this, under the guidance of a faithful
French quadroon, I was on the march at the head of my
company, and had quitted the town of Basse Terre by the
shady sun-proof avenue.

<h3>
CHAPTER LXII.
<br><br>
THE DOS D'ANE.
</h3>

<p>
As our time of morning parade in that season, was about
the hour of sunrise, our march towards the mountains was
a very pleasant one.
</p>

<p>
The old castle or citadel of Basse Terre, which the valiant
Benbow besieged in vain, in 1702, still jutted, with its four
great bulwarks, in grim strength into the water.  Its
walls were mounted by sixty pieces of French ordnance, but
now the British flag waved above them; and as we marched
on, we heard our band playing in the square,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Between St. Johnstone's and Bonnie Dundee,<br>
  I'll gar ye be fain to follow wi' me,<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
the old quickstep of the regiment.
</p>

<p>
A portion of this citadel was not more than thirty-five
years old, for when the British forces were there in 1759,
it was blown up by accident, and with it perished the
Governor, Lieutenant-colonel Desbrissay of Watson's Foot,
the 38th or old Staffordshire regiment.  He was carried
into the air, together with Major Trollop, and both being
found crushed to death, were buried in the Carmelite
church, were I saw their tombs.
</p>

<p>
Concerning the colonel, I remember Captain Glendonwyn
relating an anecdote, as we stood by his monument one
day.
</p>

<p>
"Desbrissay," said he, "was a captain of infantry at the
battle of Rocaux, which was fought against Marshal Saxe,
near Liege, on the 12th of October, 1746, when Sir John
Ligonier, after doing all that a brave general could, posted
some British battalions in hollow squares in rear of the <i>dorpts</i>
to secure the retreat of the army, which was pressed by the
splendid cavalry of Saxe, and which the Butcher of Culloden
was blundering by his cowardice and inability.  There
Desbrissay fell wounded, and while lying on the ground
was run through the body by a French officer, whose
dastardly example was immediately followed by some
Walloon infantry, thirteen of whom planted their bayonets
in his body.  Yet Desbrissay did not die; he was taken
prisoner by the French, and by the skilful treatment of
their surgeons he recovered, for there are some men who
possess as many lives as a cat.
</p>

<p>
"One day, not long after his convalescence, being at
dinner with Marshal Count de Saxe, who was deemed the
mirror of military honor, and was ever kind and gentle to
prisoners, the count said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'Pray tell me, sir, if you know the officer who used you
so barbarously on the field of Rocaux?'
</p>

<p>
"'I do, M. le Maréchal.'
</p>

<p>
"'You do?"
</p>

<p>
"'Yes&mdash;as well as I know you, M. le Comte.'
</p>

<p>
"'Pray give me his name, that I may make him an
example to all France, by tearing the epaulettes from his
shoulders, and disgracing him in front of his regiment.'
</p>

<p>
"'Excuse me, M. le Comte,' replied the brave but gentle
Desbrissay, 'I know his corps&mdash;I know his name, and I
know his rank in the French service, but I beg to decline
pointing him out to you, contenting myself with the hope,
that one day I may meet him hand to hand on the field of
honour, and then, like a true English gentleman, shall I
avenge the savage wrong he and his soldiers did me on
that fatal day at Rocaux.'
</p>

<p>
"'Monsieur, you are most generous&mdash;I shall press you no
further,' said Count Saxe.
</p>

<p>
"So spoke the gallant Desbrissay, of the old 38th; but
the day he longed for never came; he was sent to serve in
other lands, and thirteen years after that shameful defeat
near Liege, he perished in Guadaloupe, and lies there
interred in the church of the Carmelites."
</p>

<p>
And now, with this anecdote, we have brought the reader
to the rising ground which looks down on the town of Basse
Terre, the capital of the Isle of <i>Alto</i>, Guadaloupe, as it was
named by the Spaniards, because its <i>high</i> mountains
resembled those of the same name, which rise in all their
solemn beauty between the Tagus and the Guadiana in the
Estramadura of old Spain.
</p>

<p>
Many of those hills, towards which we marched, were
covered by waving woods, that drew down the clouds, and
added to the charms of the scenery; but when the morning
sun arose, the shadows fell deep on every rugged pass and
wide and fair savannah.
</p>

<p>
And now if the reader will look back with me, from our
line of march, he may see the city of Basse Terre, with
its churches of the Carmelites and Jesuits, and its
whitewashed houses, clustering round the little bay; on the
south, its old mishapen and irregular castle, perched on a
rock so lofty, that when viewed from it, our ships of the
line seemed no larger than bumboats; on the north, the
heavy bastions of Le Morne Rouge; to the eastward, wide
fields of sugar, cotton, and indigo, studded with groves,
mills, and houses; to the westward the Caribean sea, with
its blue waves running merrily on sands of silvery whiteness.
</p>

<p>
Above this border of sand, there rose green belts of
sugarcane, and over these were the hills towards which we were
marching, shrouded in the dark foliage of old primeval
forests; and higher still, the rarefied clouds that floated like
gossamer webs about their peaks.
</p>

<p>
After a halt during mid-day in the thickets, we pushed
on by a circuitous route towards a cleft or gorge in the
mountains named the Dos d'Ane, which guarded the passage
into Cabesterre, the more level and fertile part of the isle,
and there the outpost of Scipio's black band was last seen,
as our quadroon guide assured me.  The French are said to
have given the hill its name from a fancied resemblance to
the form of an ass.  The ascent was steep and rugged, as
the narrow path over which we toiled in heavy marching
order, with arms loaded and bayonets fixed&mdash;for we knew
not the moment we might be attacked&mdash;was encumbered by
masses of fallen rock; by deep rents and rifts in the cliffs of
limestone and basalt, and through these runnels of warm
and sulphureous water were trickling under the broad and
fibrous leaves of the giant tropical weeds.  Thick vapours
rose here and there from stagnant pools which were shrouded
by dwarf mangroves; but beyond this gorge which was so
gloomy, that one might fancy it led to the putrid lake of
Avernus, rose mountain slopes covered by velvet-green, and
trees of every kind.
</p>

<p>
A profound and melancholy silence reigned here; at least,
we heard only the croak of the huge frogs that squatted in
the marshy pools, or the voice of the mocking-bird in a
grove of fern-palms; and now as evening began to fall, and
we penetrated deeper into the gloomy gorge of the Dos d'Ane,
our guide warned me that we were within a short distance
of the camp of the black insurgents&mdash;less than a mile, he
thought.
</p>

<p>
A few hundred yards further on we found a deep and
wooded ravine opening to the right of the narrow path.
Therein I concealed the whole company, and so soon as the
dusk favoured, went forward to reconnoitre, leaving my men
orders to maintain the strictest silence until my return.  Guided
by the quadroon, I advanced through the cleft in the mountains,
and ere long, by the various strange and tumultuous
sounds which woke their echoes, I found that we were
approaching the camp of Scipio.
</p>

<p>
Lest the guide might play me false&mdash;for we had no great
faith in men of colour&mdash;I had shown him significantly a pair
of loaded pistols, that were stuck somewhat ostentatiously in
my waist-belt; but the poor fellow proved every way faithful,
and here, for the benefit of the uninitiated, I may mention
that a quadroon is the child of a white and a mulatto, who
is the child of a pure black and a European; but there are
also black as well as white Creoles&mdash;the former being the
children of slaves, born and reared in degradation and
slavery.

<p><a id="chap63"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER LXIII.
<br><br>
THE WORSHIPPERS OF THE DEVIL.
</h3>

<p>
A lurid light that played and wavered on the rocks and
tufted trees of the deep pass, indicated to us distinctly the
camp of the enemy, who were evidently engaged in some
orgy, ceremony, or sacrifice&mdash;we knew not which, amid their
fancied security, and under the shadow of night.
</p>

<p>
The quadroon led me up the face of the rock, by a path
known apparently only to himself and the monkeys of that
locality, it was so steep and dangerous; but after creeping
forward on our hands and knees, I suddenly found myself
overlooking a very singular and startling scene.
</p>

<p>
About fifty yards below me lay the camp of the negroes,
on a green plateau, which they had rudely but strongly
fortified by palisades of palms and bamboos, pegged or
wattled together, and banked up within and without to
form a species of breastwork.  In the centre of this arena, a
vast fire was blazing, and by its light the whole place and its
inhabitants were visible as distinctly as they might have
been at noon-day.  The circular camp seemed to swarm with
woolly heads and black forms, glowing redly in the flames,
which, as they were blown to and fro by the passing breeze,
imparted to every object a weird and unearthly aspect.  Amid
this sable crowd, gleamed bayonets, muskets, pikes, sabres, and
agricultural implements, which had been sharpened and
fashioned into impromptu weapons.  When I saw their numbers,
the ferocity of their black features, their bloodshot eyes
and white teeth, as they jabbered and grinned; and when I
heard their war-songs, their horrible yells and screams, the
smallness of the force under my command, and the desperation
of the duty on which I had been sent, came painfully
and vividly before me.
</p>

<p>
Moreover I became aware that if the safety of the abducted
M. de Thoisy was to be achieved, there was no time
to be lost in attacking them, as preparations for a deed of
horror were in rapid progress within the camp.
</p>

<p>
Nearly the whole of these insurgent slaves were from the
small kingdom of Angola, in Western Africa, and were
Gangas, or worshippers of the devil.  For centuries, the
white men have only resorted to their shores for the
purchase of slaves, and the supply has always been ample.
</p>

<p>
With wild shouts of "Gangajumba!  Gangajumba!" a
circle of hideous old negresses, in a state of perfect nudity,
danced hand in hand around an idol of dreadful aspect&mdash;the
great <i>Fetish</i>&mdash;which was reared in the centre of the camp.
They sang some gibberish, and at intervals burst into those
peals of hyena-like laughter which showed all their teeth.
Squatted on their hams, close by, were a band of negroes,
making a noise which they considered music, with the
hoarse rattle of an unbraced drum, shrill fifes, the twangle
of the banjo, and the melodious grunting of goat's-horn
trumpets.  Ere long, the mass in camp became infected by
the ardour of the negressses, and all proceeded to dance and
scream and whirl about, while loading the night-air with
discordant sounds.
</p>

<p>
Above them towered their idol, Gangajumba, at whose
shrine all this infernal hurlyburly preceded a more terrible
sacrifice.
</p>

<p>
It was of appalling aspect, being formed of tortoise-shells,
strung over a figure of basket-work, and streaked with red
paint to imitate ribs and bones.  It was eight feet in height,
by nearly three feet broad.  The enormous head was
surrounded by a string of white men's skulls, scraped clean and
white; but the deep cuts and incisions in them bore terrible
evidence of the deaths by which these victims perished.
Tall, feathery palm-leaves waved over its brow; two pieces
of glass composed the eyes, and when a lighted lamp was
placed in its head by an old white-haired Congo savage, who
acted as ganga or priest, a glare shone through them that
was grotesquely terrific.
</p>

<p>
All this, when viewed by the lurid light of the gigantic
fire which cast its gleams on the impending rocks of the
deep pass, and on the drooping palms that waved slowly in
the night-wind, formed such a scene as I had never beheld.
In the background, La Souffrière, or the Brimstone
Mountain, which rose to a stupendous height, added to the
shadowy horror of the landscape, by emitting from its
various craters, sudden jets of light and volumes of black
smoke, starred with myriad sparks of fire.
</p>

<p>
The sable outlaws who were revolving with such frantic
energy beneath us, were clad in all kinds of finery, stolen
from the plantations they had destroyed; and these were
worn in the most absurd manner.  Thus, I observed one
gigantic fellow who had a white straw hat adorned by nearly
a dozen of regimental feathers plaited ingeniously around it.
A pair of gold epaulettes hung at his bare, brawny neck, by
a string of gilt buttons, and lower down were several crosses
of St. Louis, torn, doubtless, from the breasts of dead
Frenchmen, worn among ladies' jewels and a necklace of
parrot's feathers.
</p>

<p>
"That man is the chief," whispered my copper-coloured
guide, with a voice reduced to a whisper by alarm.
</p>

<p>
"Scipio,&mdash;who destroyed Mademoiselle du Plessis?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; and that is his tent with the standard in front
of it."
</p>

<p>
"I cannot see a standard," said I, surveying the cluster of
wigwams, which were grouped like bee-hives in a corner of
the camp; "but I see a man's head upon a pole or pike."
</p>

<p>
"A white man's head?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Ah,&mdash;it belonged to M. le Procureur du Roi, at Basse
Terre; they caught him when riding near the town one
evening, and his head was off almost before he missed it.
Well, that is the standard of Scipio, who is now
stringing his banjo 'for a song.'"
</p>

<p>
"I shall teach this modern Scipio Africanus a sharp
lesson to-night.  But I do not see M. de Thoisy."
</p>

<p>
"He is in that tent with the <i>fetishes</i> around it," replied
my guide, pointing to a booth which was formed of bamboos
and yellow grass matting, and on the sides of which there
hung nearly a hundred lesser fetishes, as those guardians of
the household or person are named by the negroes of Congo
and Angola, and which are composed of hoofs, hair, bones
of animals, beaks, skulls and claws of birds, fish-bones,
parrots' feathers, or old nails, for nothing is too mean to form
the <i>Lares</i> of the degraded Angolians.
</p>

<p>
"So he is there?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;bound hand and foot.  Why they saved him, and
slew M. le Procureur whom he was accompanying for an
evening ride, I cannot divine."
</p>

<p>
"When will they sacrifice him?"
</p>

<p>
"When the moon rises above the peak of La Souffrière."
</p>

<p>
"So soon? then, by Jove, we have no time to lose!"
</p>

<p>
"He is to endure the most dreadful tortures."
</p>

<p>
"How?"
</p>

<p>
"By iron hooks, inserted under his shoulder-blades, he
will be suspended alive over a slow fire, and his lower joints
will be cut off one by one, with the sharp knives of the
gangas, beginning with the toes, and so proceeding upward
to the knees and hip-joints; but few live, with the fire
playing about them, until the knives come <i>that</i> length."
</p>

<p>
"When will the moon be over La Souffrière?" said I,
starting up at the risk of discovery.
</p>

<p>
"In another hour," replied the young quadroon, consulting
his watch.
</p>

<p>
"Then we have just time to bring up my men, and make
a dash at the palisades," I replied in a loud whisper, as we
crawled backward, until we reached the narrow path which
led us down the rocks, and from thence I hastened back to
the ravine in which we had concealed my company.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER LXII.
<br><br>
SCIPIO.
</h3>

<p>
"Our orders are, that we take no prisoners, but strike
terror by the fury of our attack and the severity of our
treatment," said I, as the company re-entered the pass; for
human life had now become such a cheap commodity, that
if we set little value on our own existence, we put none
whatever on that of others&mdash;of the insurgent negroes,
especially.
</p>

<p>
Dividing the company in two, as we drew near the camp.
I heard once more the wild clamour of its occupants, and
saw the wavering gleams of their watchfire falling on rock
and tree.  With one subdivision of forty men I marched to
assail the palisade in front, while my lieutenant&mdash;an officer
who afterwards commanded a battalion of the 60th under
the Duke of Wellington, with the remainder, led by the
quadroon guide, made a dètour to the left, and ascended by
the secret path already mentioned.
</p>

<p>
On him, and this flank movement, I principally placed
my hopes of success; from the point he could attain, he
was to throw a shower of hand-grenades into the camp, and
then, under cover of a volley, rush down among its dingy
occupants with the charged bayonet, while I attacked them
from the pathway at the same moment.
</p>

<p>
The grenades, which have now unaccountably sunk
into disuse, were then much used by our regiment,
and by all grenadier companies.  They are hollow balls
or shells, two inches and a half in diameter, which,
after being charged with fine powder, are set on fire
by means of a slender fuse driven into the touch-hole.
On exploding, it carries mutilation and death to all in its
vicinity.
</p>

<p>
I turned to the peak of La Souffrière; the time was
critical.  The rising moon filled all the clear sky beyond the
sulphur mountain with a liquid light, amid which the
brightest stars were lost.  In ten minutes she would be above
its peak, from which a stupendous column of black smoke
was now ascending for miles into the pure blue sky.
</p>

<p>
Softly we drew near the negro fortress, and I could see
among the dense mangroves and shrubbery the occasional
glitter of arms, as our left subdivision ascended the height,
while we toiled straight forward, over rocks and stones, and
matters less pleasant&mdash;such as the mutilated and charred
remains of the white population who had fallen victims to
the worshippers of the Fetish, and whose cloven caputs were
strung around his monstrous visage.  Snakes hissed among
the long grass, frogs squattered, and gorged rats and
land-crabs scampered away by dozens on all sides, as we
approached the palisades.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly a shrill yell, and the explosion of a musket, the
ball of which whistled past me, informed us that the black
sentinel who watched the road that led through the Dos
d'Ane had perceived us, just as I formed the subdivision in
line, rank entire, or what is often termed in Indian file, to
show a greater front.
</p>

<p>
"Forward men," I exclaimed; "down with the palisades,
and at them with the bayonet!"
</p>

<p>
With a cheer we rushed on; six men with sharp hatchets
assailed the bamboo palisade, which fell like reeds before
their sturdy blows; and just as Scipio and his sooty
ragamuffins hurried to defend the gap, a loud hurrah on our
left, and the explosion of forty hand-grenades that fell
whizzing through the darkness, each bursting among them
with a loud report and a ruddy glare, paralyzed the savages,
and in a moment struck them with a panic, which a combined
cross-fire, and an attack in front and flank with the
charged bayonet, completed.  They threw down their arms
and fled by a passage on the other side of their pah, or
camp, abandoning to us all their wigwams, their accumulated
plunder, the idol, their fetishes, and what was of much
more importance to me, their miserable prisoner, old
Monsieur George de Thoisy, whom we found tied by manilla
ropes, and lying almost senseless with fear, in expectation of
a barbarous death.  Scipio was overtaken by Sergeant
Drumbirrel, who, as he stumbled down the rocks, ran three feet of
his pike through his body and killed him on the spot.
</p>

<p>
By the explosion of the grenades and by the cross-fire we
had poured into the place, nearly four hundred blacks were
killed or wounded within it.  Many of the latter were
bayoneted by our men, whose legs and feet they bit and
tore with their teeth and nails, like wild animals.
</p>

<p>
"Take care of the women," I exclaimed, as our fire fell
among them.
</p>

<p>
"Where the men are so bad, captain, the squaws cannot
be very good," replied a soldier; "but we must not shoot
them I suppose, at all events."
</p>

<p>
Among other things, we found a supper which some of
the Congo fair ones had been cooking in a vast copper
brought from a sugar-mill.  It was highly seasoned in
honour of the contemplated demise of M. de Thoisy; and
its odour was so savoury, that many of my fellows were
tempted to partake of the contents, which consisted of
ducks, geese, chickens, &amp;c.; but on Tom Telfer and others,
who mistrusted the culinary tastes of the ladies of Congo,
poking deeper with their bayonets, they fished up, to their
own great merriment and the disgust of the others, two fat
monkeys, a pointer bitch and her litter of puppies, all
redolent, however, of pepper, nutmeg, and pimento.
</p>

<p>
We followed the fugitive negroes for nearly a mile beyond
the pass, shooting them down like crows, till we got tired of
the work, as the poor devils were too terrified to fire a shot
in return, or had thrown away their muskets; so, by sound
of bugle I recalled my men&mdash;only eight of whom had fallen
in storming the stockade&mdash;for now columns of smoke and
sheets of red flame, rising from the cane-fields on both flanks
and in front, showed that the retreating blacks had fired the
country on all sides.  We heard the crackling of the canes,
with the crash of cocoa-trees, while, with the slightest
breath of wind, the smoke enveloped us to the verge of
suffocation, with a storm of red sparks which made us
apprehensive that the ammunition in the pouches might explode.
</p>

<p>
Beyond the pass opened Cabesterre, and at our feet lay a
beautiful savannah (the <i>Sabana Verde</i> of the Spaniards); it
was of great extent, and its greenness, so pale in the light of
the moon, which was now high above La Souffrière, was
darkened here and there by the sombre foliage of the
mahogany-trees under which the listless cattle lay to catch the
currents of air.  In other places, the yellower tints of the
savannah were dotted by solemn scriptural palms, some with
drooping branches, and others with foliage that stood up like
tufts of ostrich-feathers.
</p>

<p>
Our grim work was over now!
</p>

<p>
We buried the dead in a trench; destroyed their idol,
and returned through the pass to head-quarters which we
reached on the following night, and there I was thanked for
my services and small display of skill and strategy by Sir
Charles Grey in general orders.
</p>

<p>
<i>En route</i>, we left M. de Thoisy (a fine-looking old
gentleman who interlarded every remark with eternal references
to his late most Christian Majesty) at the avenue of his own
mansion, where he never hoped to have been again, and
where he overwhelmed me with vows, blessings, thanks, and
invitations.  Gratitude for preservation, after all he had
undergone, made the poor man ready to worship me, and his
heart filled to overflowing.
</p>

<p>
I remember that on returning from this expedition I lost
two of my men, who fell into a hot marsh, and were
suffocated before we could extricate them.

CHAPTER LXV.
<br><br>
CAPTURE OF POINT A PETRE.
</h3>

<p>
By the time I returned to head-quarters with my company,
Sir George Grey had matured his plans for the recapture of
that portion of Guadaloupe which is named Grande Terre.  He
summoned aid from the neighbouring islands.  There first
came into the roadstead of Basse Terre, H.M.S. <i>Veteran</i>,
with two companies of the line from St. Vincent, four from
St. Lucia, and two battalions of seamen, under Captain
Lewis Robertson, a gallant naval officer, whom Admiral
Jervis, in the despatch which records his death, termed
"the child of misfortune."  Two flank companies of ours
(though Fusiliers, we, like the Guards, had them at that
time) led by Lieutenants Price and Colepepper, came in the
<i>Winchelsea</i>, under Viscount Garlies.  Our Grenadier company
was the tallest, and our light company the smartest I ever
beheld.
</p>

<p>
The encomiums bestowed on me by the general after
the affair in the pass of Dos d'Ane, fired me with the desire
of achieving something new; and I had hitherto escaped so
well, that I actually began to conceive myself all but
bullet-proof, like some of Tilly's Imperialists of old.  In this
idea I was doomed, however, to be soon undeceived, and
pretty roughly too.
</p>

<p>
On a fine evening in July, we found ourselves in the
brigade of Brigadier Symes, with the first light battalion,
under Lieutenant-Colonel Gomm; the second light battalion
under Major Ross, of the 31st; the Grenadiers under
Lieutenant-Colonel Fisher, and one battalion of seamen led by
Captain Robertson, of the <i>Veteran</i>, all destined to assail the
French at Point à Petre.  Our landing was effected at
Point de l'Ance à Canot, on the southern shore of Grande
Terre; Le Gosier lay about a league on our left; St. Ann's
about two leagues on our right; a range of mountains&mdash;the
heights of Caille&mdash;were in our front, and beyond them towered
La Souffriére, vomiting flames of sulphur into the clear sky,
and serving as a volcanic lamp to light us to death or victory.
</p>

<p>
After disembarking under the guns of two of our frigates,
the <i>Solebay</i> and <i>Winchelsea</i>, we advanced to the heights of
Morne Mascot, driving the French outposts before us in
flight and disorder; but, as we are rapidly approaching a
very important epoch in my story&mdash;indeed, the culminating
point of all novels, narratives, and plays&mdash;I shall briefly
sketch the military operations which led thereto, though
unfortunately they failed at that time to reconquer
Guadaloupe.
</p>

<p>
The French troops in Grande Terre were a portion of an
expedition which had lately come from Brest, and were
under the direction of Victor Hugues and other commissioners
who had been sent from Paris to avail themselves of
any commotions which might arise in the island; but their
chief hope had been placed in the mulattoes and negros,
whose leader Scipio had gone to his last account, as already
related, with three feet of Sergeant Drumbirrel's pike in his
body.  A decree of the French convention had proffered
liberty, equality, and fraternity to every negro who joined
the French standard; thus, M. Victor Hugues, the Republican
commander-in-chief, had soon several thousands under
his orders, and dreadful enemies we found them, alike in
time of truce and battle.
</p>

<p>
When we marched from the heights of Morne Mascot to
attack the troops of Hugues at Point à Petre, orders were
strictly enjoined us, not to fire a shot in the assault, as the
brigadier wished to storm the town by a night surprise,
after out-flanking (if possible) a perilous outpost which lay
between us and it.
</p>

<p>
We heard the frigates' bells in the distance, announcing
the hour of eight as we moved off.
</p>

<p>
The twilight changed rapidly to night, which proved dark
and cloudy, no light being visible but that which gleamed at
times on the sky from the crater of La Souffrière, as it shot
up red and yellow sulphur, with the usual showers of
glittering sparks.  A march through a well-cultivated valley
bordered by groves of pale-yellow lime-trees, rich in verdure
of wondrous luxuriance, and studded by the wigwams of
negro slaves covered by broad plaintain-leaves, led us towards
Point à Petre.  By the wayside the snow-white amaryllis
grew under the light foliage of the vine, and the golden
globes of the orange-trees waved to and fro, like the tufts of
the fan-palm, whose leaves bent like ostrich-feathers before
the soft trade-wind that came from the distant sea.
</p>

<p>
In the occasional flashes of the sulphur-mountain I could
see the bayonets of the columns gleam at times, while,
under the conduct of our quadroon guide we descended into
deep ravines, where the plaintain, the cotton, and mahogany
trees cast their darkest shadows on our path, and where the
scared monkeys chattered as they leaped from branch to
branch; yet we marched on in profound silence, our men
being conscious of the stern necessity for reaching the
outposts of Hugues undiscovered.  But all our plans were
frustrated by an error of the guide, who contrived matters so ill,
that after a long, tedious, and harassing tramp by night over
ground of the most difficult nature, about four in the
morning the leading section of the advanced guard suddenly
heard a voice cry,
</p>

<p>
"Qui vive?"
</p>

<p>
"France!" replied Haystone of ours at hap-hazard, and
with great presence of mind; but it served no end; a blue
port-fire was seen burning steadily behind a palisade for an
instant; then there was a vivid flash&mdash;a loud whizz, and
a dose of canister shot from a 32-pounder gun laid
several of our men on the turf to rise no more.  This
announced that we were close upon the intrenched outpost
which the brigadier had resolved to <i>avoid</i>, that by
outflanking it, we might reach Point à Petre undiscovered.
In his anger, Lord Kildonan nearly pistolled the guide.
</p>

<p>
"Forward with the bayonet!" was now the cry on all
hands, and led by the earl and Major Ross, two companies
of Fusiliers rushed at the outwork pell-mell in the dark,
ignorant alike where they were going and what they were
attacking; but, in three minutes the post was stormed, the
cannon spiked, and the picquet or guard driven in, and then
we pressed forward double-quick on the town, which lay
beyond it.
</p>

<p>
There the report of the cannon had summoned the foe to
arms; and the gleam of torches, with the hiss of rockets,
announced that they were in full preparation.  From a
bastion named Le Morne de Gouvernement, a heavy fire of
round shot and grape enfiladed the brigade, as we dashed
with a wild hurrah through the streets, driving before us the
half-armed and half-clad soldiers and negroes, who were not
formed in any order, so sudden was our irruption among
them.
</p>

<p>
A negro aimed at me from a window, and the ball passed
through my cap; but my old comrade, Tom Telfer, shot him
dead at the moment he was casting about his firelock to
reload.  Every man who withstood us for an instant was
shot down or bayoneted; and in an incredibly short space
of time we found ourselves victorious, at the end of a
street strewn with corpses, black, white, and all shades of
copper colour.  Dragging a large battery gun, which they
had found somewhere, a party of the Naval Brigade,
stripped to their waists, came rushing after us with a right
royal cheer, though under its heavy iron wheels were
crushed many of the unfortunates who lay writhing or dead
on the ground; and by the blaze of some burning houses,
we could see them lying in its track, with skulls crushed
and intestines protruding; but one discharge of canister-shot
from this piece of cannon completed the discomfiture of
the flying foe, and Point à Petre was ours&mdash;for a time.
</p>

<p>
The guns and mortars of Le Morne de Gouvernement
were still firing at random, pounding the houses of the town
to pieces, and crushing tiles, pillars, roofs, and walls, upon
us, ding, dong, and splinter, till our men became thoroughly
bewildered; then, as the devil would have it, in the darkness
and confusion they began to fire upon each other; thus,
a volley from the 1st light battalion tore suddenly through
the Fusiliers, killing and wounding many, and unhorsing
both Lieutenant Rolster, our adjutant, and Doctor Splints.
Rendered furious by this, the Scots Fusiliers were about to
turn their fire upon their comrades, but were prevented by
the exertions of Lord Kildonan and the brigadier, by whose
side fell Lieutenant-Colonel Gomm of the 55th, and Captain
Robertson of the <i>Veteran</i>, mortally wounded.
</p>

<p>
"I was at this time disabled by a severe wound in my
right arm," says Brigadier Symes, in his despatch; "and I
was much bruised by my horse, which was killed and fell
upon me.  Finding it impossible, under these circumstances,
to complete the destruction of the enemy's stores, the troops
were ordered to leave the town and reform on the heights of
Caille, from whence, on approaching, we had driven the
enemy, and taken two pieces of cannon."
</p>

<p>
Amid the dreadful confusion which ensued in the streets,
poor old Captain Glendonwyn was killed by a stray shot, with
many of our best men; and three of our lieutenants, Price,
Knollis, and Colepepper, lay wounded on the ground; when
our bugles sounded a retreat in the dark, and full of wrath
and fury we drew off towards the heights of Caille.
</p>

<p>
While getting the survivors of my company disentangled,
as it were, and formed in some order, a half-spent musket-shot
broke my sword-arm; I staggered, sank to the ground,
and was nearly trodden to death, as the naval battalion, led
by Lieutenant Percival of the <i>Adder</i>, rushed over me in full
retreat, before the returning French.  It was a divine
mercy that they had spiked, and left in the rear, their great
gun, otherwise I must have perished under its wheels.
</p>

<p>
Some time after this, I staggered up, and found that the
negroes and mulattoes who wore the tricoloured cockade,
were butchering our wounded.  Inspired with new strength
by the imminence of my danger, I hurried towards the end of
the street, which presented a dreadful spectacle of bloodshed
and destruction; and there a horse passed me, dragging his
dead rider, a French field-officer, by the bridle, which the
poor fellow's left hand yet clutched with a death-grip.  I
grasped the rein with my teeth, as my right arm hung
powerless by my side, wrenched away the dead man's hand
with my left, and springing into the saddle, urged the
terrified horse to a gallop, and Point à Petre, its flaming
houses and blood-stained streets, were soon far behind me.
</p>

<p>
Mistaking the path our retreating troops pursued, I rode
on without knowing whither; my sole desire being to avoid
men of colour; and so my scared steed sped over miles of a
flat savannah.
</p>

<p>
Just as day was breaking, faint with toil, pain, and
lassitude, I found the impossibility of longer keeping the
saddle, and on dismounting, the horse galloped away and left
me.
</p>

<p>
I was near a thick coppice.  A little runnel, bordered by
blue blossoms and crimson convolvoli, ran through the long
prairie grass; and in its tiny current, a flock of blue and
green parrots were dipping their gaudy pinions; but when
I stooped to drink, they rose like a covey of fairy partridges,
and flew screaming and whistling into the trees.
</p>

<p>
The sun was now up, and being somewhat refreshed by a
draught from the pure, cool spring, I gazed wistfully about
me, and found that I was near what appeared to be the
house of a wealthy planter.  Passing a handsome gate, I
crossed a little lawn, which was bordered by a circle of
maypole aloes, that towered to the height of thirty feet at
least to their tufts of yellow foliage, and had green creepers
festooned like garlands from stem to stem.
</p>

<p>
It was an old house of substantial aspect for the Antilles;
its sugar-mills were concealed by a thick grove of trees; all
was still around it, and its green jealousies remained closed;
but in the morning sun its white walls shone gaily, amid
fences of golden and crimson-coloured flowers, while on each
side of the old-fashioned French porch, there towered two
lordly cedars, on the branches of which a number of parrots
and other wild birds were perched coquetting and pluming
their wings.
</p>

<p>
Sick with agony, want, and mortification for the result of
our attack on Point à Petre, human nature could achieve
no more for me; and just as the house-door opened, I sank
on the flight of steps which led to it.
</p>

<p>
An exclamation of mingled pity and astonishment from
a female voice fell upon my ear, and I looked up with
haggard eyes.
</p>

<p>
Was it a dream?
</p>

<p>
I know not, for I fainted; but the fair face that hung
over mine, as the light went out of my eyes, was that
of&mdash;Amy Lee!

<h3>
CHAPTER LXVI.
<br><br>
THE OBEAH NEGRO.
</h3>

<p>
It seemed to me as if two or three days must have
elapsed before recovering perfect consciousness, and such
was the case; then I appeared to waken to it, as from the
long and delirious lethargy of the dreadful yellow fever, for
I had lost much more blood than I was aware of.
</p>

<p>
I found myself in bed&mdash;in a luxurious couch&mdash;and in a
large and airy apartment.  Its ceiling was lofty; painted a
light azure and starred with gold; the flowing
window-curtains, being sprinkled with lime-juice for coolness,
imparted a delightful fragrance, which, with the summer
odours that were wafted through the open jealousies, proved
delicious to a feverish patient.  Everything about me
betokened wealth, splendour, and tropical luxury.  From
each of the three tall windows of my apartment, on
which the flower-covered verandah without cast a chastening
shadow, hung a basket of creeping plants, and in one of
these a pair of beautiful humming-birds had built their little
nests of cotton, pilfered no doubt, by their tiny beaks, from
the fresh-bursting buds of the cotton-tree.
</p>

<p>
The intense stiffness, benumbed and leaden sensation in
my right arm, at once informed me, that the bones had
been set, splinted, and bandaged, but by whom I knew not.
There were dreams of soft female voices having spoken to
me; and memories of their faces seemed to float before me,
amid the misty memories of pain and suffering; but these
were mere dreams, doubtless, like the vision of Amy Lee
appearing at the porch of the villa, as I sank in agony and
almost in despair on the steps that led to it.
</p>

<p>
After lying still for a time with closed eyes, I looked
around me again, half in expectation that some <i>other</i>
scene&mdash;perhaps a tent, a ship's cabin, a bivouac, or something
equally familiar would display itself; but no&mdash;the splendid
bedchamber remained unchanged in all its details, save
that it now had one other occupant than me.
</p>

<p>
A beautiful young girl, no doubt, the reader may suppose!
</p>

<p>
Not at all&mdash;nothing nearly so pleasant; but a hideous
old negro, who was slowly approaching on tiptoe, softly,
and with his stealthy and glittering eyes fixed on mine.
Danger was my first thought, but this old man was without
any knife or weapon.  His grey woolly locks straggled like
horsehair under a blue cotton kerchief, which encircled his
huge round caput, beneath a broad rush-plaited hat, in the
band of which two short tobacco-pipes were jauntily stuck.
His jacket and short wide trowsers were composed of white
cotton striped with flaming red; but his feet were bare
like his breast, on which hung a necklace or fetish of old
buttons, rusty nails, bits of broken glass, and green or scarlet
parrots' feathers; to all of which he attached, no doubt,
some deep and cabalistic value.  The tattooing which was
visible on his black breast, indicated that in his own
sun-scorched country he had been esteemed as a chief or warrior
of note, before he had been compelled by the whip of the
white man, to relinquish the hatchet and arrows for the
spade and hoe of the sugar-fields; and now, as he drew
nearer, I recognized an old acquaintance.
</p>

<p>
"Benoit," said I; "Benoit."
</p>

<p>
"Ya&mdash;ya, massa le capitaine," he replied, showing all
his yellow fangs; "Benoit le Noir&mdash;you memory ob me,
massa?"
</p>

<p>
"Remember you, old fellow&mdash;of course I do!"
</p>

<p>
"Très bon!  I watch massa in his sleep&mdash;me an Obeah
nigger," he added, handing to me a crystal jug containing a
draught of some cool and medicated preparation, which
wonderfully strengthened and revived me.
</p>

<p>
"Where am I, Benoit?"
</p>

<p>
"In Carucueira."
</p>

<p>
"Where?" I exclaimed with astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"La Grande Terre de Guadaloupe, him called
now&mdash;Carucueira in the days of painted warriors."
</p>

<p>
"I have been ill&mdash;weak, Benoit."
</p>

<p>
"Ya&mdash;massa le capitaine have leaden shot in him body."
</p>

<p>
"Impossible&mdash;my arm was broken by a ball which, however
did not penetrate deep, though I have lost much
blood."
</p>

<p>
"Oui&mdash;ya; but shot go very fast in the air&mdash;massa le
capitaine no see him enter."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, that is all bosh, old Snowball."
</p>

<p>
"Ah&mdash;pardonnez&mdash;mong Dew&mdash;ya, oui," continued poor
Benoit, whose language was a strange medley; "shot be in
<i>here</i> massa."
</p>

<p>
"Where?"
</p>

<p>
"In massa's arm, at elbow; take him out,
presto!&mdash;crack! diable&mdash;in a minute."
</p>

<p>
"How?" said I, half amused by his pertinacity.
</p>

<p>
Benoit deposited his broad hat upon the floor; then
sinking upon his knees he gravely took the fetish from his
neck, ran his black fingers over the trash which composed
it, using many conjurations, mumbling like a Mahometan
over his rosary, and bobbing like a Chinaman in a
joss-house.  Then approaching me with great solemnity in his
face, and a curious and crafty leer in his eyes, he passed his
hands gently over my wounded arm three times, in the style
of a mesmeric professor.  How the sensation was produced,
I know not, but each time that he did so a nervous tremour
pervaded the broken limb, and at the third pass a musket
ball seemed to drop from my finger-points upon the bed.
</p>

<p>
"Bon, bon! fetish good!" exclaimed Benoit, "massa le
capitaine be soon cured now."
</p>

<p>
I had neither strength to laugh at the cunning of the
Obeah negro, or to compliment this sleight of hand, by which,
like others who pretend to be in league with Obi, and
to have especial power through their <i>fetish</i>, he had obtained,
I have no doubt, a tolerable livelihood among the ignorant
and superstitious slaves, and exerted a great influence over
them for good or for evil.
</p>

<p>
"Massa look astonished! ah, mong Dew, that be nothing
to Père Benoit le Noir!  There was a damn black nigger
from le Looward isles come to me ill&mdash;berry ill; ya&mdash;oui, so
I cure him presto! draw from him belly a big cannon-ball&mdash;jolly
after that&mdash;damn him, hoe sugar and sing.  Massa
le capitaine tink ob that&mdash;ya oui.  Capitaine bucra no
savey him have <i>another</i> bullet here?"
</p>

<p>
"Where?"
</p>

<p>
"In him leg."
</p>

<p>
"In my leg? no, no Quashy&mdash;I savey nothing of the kind."
</p>

<p>
"A big bullet there, though&mdash;mong Dew, Gorramighty
ya oui!"
</p>

<p>
"Go; you tease me by all this bosh," said I, impatiently.
</p>

<p>
"Me poor slave, but me known to Obi&mdash;me savey better
than bucra man," replied Benoit, resuming his fetish and
broad-leaved castor, with a half-mock air of offended
dignity; "but le capitaine would like something to eat&mdash;just
leetle picking?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, thank you."
</p>

<p>
"Young leg ob monkey&mdash;bon, good, with pepper and
pimento&mdash;très bon!"
</p>

<p>
"No, no."
</p>

<p>
"Guana&mdash;like big green lizard&mdash;tender, sweet&mdash;dam bon
très good; you savey it?"
</p>

<p>
"Stuff; get me a bit of boiled chicken and a glass of
Nevis wine; but ere you go, tell me where I am, as I have
naturally some curiosity about it."
</p>

<p>
"In the villa de Thoisy."
</p>

<p>
"What&mdash;in the house of Monsieur Thoisy, whom I saved
from Scipio at the pass of Dos d'Ane!"
</p>

<p>
"Ya, massa, oui," replied the negro, with a grin from ear
to ear; but adding gravely, "but Massa de Thoisy be far
happier if offered up to Obi."
</p>

<p>
"I believe he has some doubts of that, Benoit; but how
came <i>you</i> here?"
</p>

<p>
"Mamselle Eulalie&mdash;you memory ob her?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Benoit&mdash;how shall I ever forget her?"
</p>

<p>
"She sent me to Massa de Thoisy as a present&mdash;I served
her father long, massa, berry faithful, and he loved me well,
though a poor black man, berry well&mdash;bo-hoo-o-o-o!"
and with a true negro outburst of grief, the old fellow
left me, weeping like a child.

<h3>
CHAPTER LXVII.
<br><br>
M. DE THOISY.
</h3>

<p>
Wearied by this conversation, troubled by the recollection
of poor Eulalie, which conflicted with the strange but
vivid vision of Amy Lee, I closed my eyes and strove to
sleep; but lay long awake, gazing through the open
jealousies upon the verdant lawn, its circle of tall aloes, and
the shrubbery of a garden that lay before the windows,
where the flaming foliage of the <i>Bois immortel</i>, the dark
green leaves of the laurel and the blossoms of the jasmine
grew together; where flowering parasites of unknown names
drooped a hundred and fifty feet from the trees to which
they clung&mdash;creepers of wondrous beauty and luxuriance all
intertwisted like the mystic serpents in a Celtic tomb or
Runic stone.
</p>

<p>
While lying thus between sleeping and waking in an
uneasy doze, a sound fell on my ear.  I thought the figure
of a female drew close and bent over me.  I dreamt that I
was a child again, and that my mother was there, with her
calm, earnest eyes, and sad but gentle face, hovering close to
mine.
</p>

<p>
Tears came to my eyes; I started up&mdash;the figure drew
abruptly back, and lo! there stood by my bedside a lovely
dark-eyed girl, with rich golden hair.  She sprang away
with a step like a startled fawn, and then I sank again to
sleep, for the noon of a tropical summer day was at its zenith,
and lassitude overpowered me.
</p>

<p>
This was all very pleasant and romantic; but I had soon
other visitors, in the shape of huge mosquitoes whose bites
were like red-hot pins thrust into the flesh; flocks of moths,
giant in size and diabolical in aspect, that dropped, soft and
clammy, on my hands and face at night; and all kinds of
entomological and ereptological specimens of little winged
devils with sharp snouts or stings and appetites that seemed
insatiable.
</p>

<p>
The information of my sable guardian proved correct.  I
was really in the splendid and hospitable mansion of M. de
Thoisy, who visited my apartment next day, to express the
pleasure he felt in being able to make me some return for
the great service I had done him on that terrible night in
the camp of the negroes.
</p>

<p>
The old royalist planter was a fair specimen of a class
now entirely extinct&mdash;the French gentleman of the old
school or the last days of the monarchy; a time which we
associate with periwigs and wide sleeves, ruffles and small
swords; studied politeness, great suavity, and an almost
ferocious punctilio&mdash;a sense of honour so keen as to be
carried to an extent quite perilous in the old days of
duelling; but his soft and kind manner was in every way
calculated to win, and impress me with the conviction that
I was quite conferring an obligation upon him in availing
myself of his hospitality.
</p>

<p>
He was the representative of one of the oldest and best
families in the island; thus all his stories and recollections
were, like his predilections, somewhat antiquated.  One of
his ancestors was the Sieur de Thoisy, who was appointed
"by his most Christian Majesty," as he always phrased it,
in 1645, lieutenant-general of the French Antilles, and
seneschal of St. Christopher's; and the armorial bearings
of this personage, encircled by the collar of the Ordre
Militaire des Chevaliers de l'Epée, were carved in walnut wood
over the doors of several of the rooms, and stuccoed on the
ceilings.
</p>

<p>
For several days M. de Thoisy was the only person I saw,
save my doctor and Benoit le Noir.
</p>

<p>
"I fear you must have lost much money by the revolt of
the slaves," said I, on one occasion.
</p>

<p>
"I lost nearly the whole of <i>them</i>," said he, "and slaves are
money in the Antilles.  However, I mean to follow the
fortunes of Messieurs les Comtes d'Artois and Provence,
who have resolved to make their home in Edinburgh&mdash;le
capital d'Ecosse.  I am taking measures to transfer al
the money I possess to Britain; the Antilles are no longer
a safe abiding-place for a French royalist gentleman,
especially for such as have the misfortune to be born like
me, monsieur, with <i>de</i> prefixed to their name.  No, no,
<i>pardieu</i>!  M. <i>de</i> Thoisy will never condescend to wear
the tricoloured cockade, to be plain Citoyen Thoisy, and
hear his wife and daughters called citoyennes by a vile
canaille who fraternize with savages and wear the bonnet
rouge?"
</p>

<p>
"So you have a family, monsieur?" said I, as my dream
of two dark eyes and of the golden curls occurred to me, and
my curiosity was excited.
</p>

<p>
"I have <i>three</i> daughters, M. le Capitaine," said he coldly;
and then, as if to change the subject, added, "this is the
second time those canaille from Congo and Angola have
revolted in Guadaloupe."
</p>

<p>
"The second time?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, <i>sacre</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"When did it occur before?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, <i>parbleu!</i> in 1656."
</p>

<p>
"A long time ago?"
</p>

<p>
"During the reign of his most Christian Majesty
Louis XIV.," said monsieur, bowing low at the name.
</p>

<p>
"And scarcely worth remembering now," I replied,
smiling.
</p>

<p>
"Pardon me, M. le Capitaine," said the old gentleman,
bowing again so low that his wig nearly fell off; "but men
of my years have long memories.  We have always had vast
cargoes of slaves from Angola; but in that year they were,
most unwisely, trained to the use of arms by the lieutenant-governor,
M. Houelle: thus encouraged, on discovering their
own strength, two Angolians conceived the project (like our
precious rascal Scipio) of exterminating all the male whites,
but of preserving the females for wives, and of crowning two
kings of the race of Angola&mdash;one in Basse Terre, and the
other in Grande Terre.  A night for the rising was named
and ere morning every white man in Guadaloupe would
have been barbarously slain; but as God and St. Louis
would have it, certain slaves from Cape de Verde, who loved
not those of Angola, informed the governor of what was
impending; so the whites were all accoutred and ready.  The
Angolians rose in arms; a fifteen days' conflict ensued, and
all Grande Terre was ravaged before they were crushed.
One-half were shot, hanged, or burned, and all who were
taken were restored to slavery; but, sacre! not until their
ears had been shred off by a huge pair of shears, to mark
them for the future."
</p>

<p>
"This seems the most antique house I have seen in the
Antilles," said I wearily, to change the subject; but every
remark touched some hidden spring, and produced a
reminiscence.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, <i>mon Dieu</i>, you have observed that!" exclaimed my
host with pleasure, for this house was his vanity&mdash;his little
weakness.  "It was built by M. Aubert, who was governor
of Guadaloupe in 1643, for his most Christian Majesty
Louis XIII.  That gay, artful, and dazzling blonde, Madame
Fayolle, occupied this very apartment&mdash;tradition says, this
very bed.  <i>Corboeuf!</i> monsieur, think of that!"
</p>

<p>
"I am greatly honoured, perhaps; but who was she?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Mon Dieu!</i> he has never heard of Madame Fayolle!"
</p>

<p>
"I regret that I have not."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Est-il possible!</i>"
</p>

<p>
"On my honour."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Tête Dieu</i>&mdash;you astonish me!"
</p>

<p>
"'Tis the case, nevertheless," said I, feeling more amused
by his surprise than ashamed of my own ignorance.
</p>

<p>
"She was here in Guadaloupe all that Mesdames Pompadour,
Du Barri, or Maintenon, were at Versailles or the
Louvre.  Her beauty and intrigues made her queen of the
island, as I shall have the honour of telling you."
</p>

<p>
"Another story," said I, with a well-bred grimace.
</p>

<p>
"Oui, Monsieur le Capitaine," said the old gentleman,
making three such profound bows, that at each of them I
felt my wounded arm twinge.  "In the days of M. Aubert's
government, I mean during the reign of&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, his most Christian Majesty&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Louis XIII.; exactly monsieur, our colonists were
sadly in want of wives, and it is not every one who can
realize a Venus in a copper-coloured Carib squaw, or a
tattooed Congo negress, with a fish-bone in her nostrils; so
the Frenchmen in Guadaloupe tilled the land, sowed, reaped,
boiled the sugar, pressed the vines, and made money in
peace and profound tranquillity, until a certain Madame
Fayolle conceived the brilliant, but unfortunate idea of
bringing a stock of handsome young damsels from Paris to
Guadaloupe.  You may imagine the excitement their arrival
caused among Frenchmen who had not seen a white female
face for years.  Scarcely had the ship's anchor dropped into
the roadstead of Basse Terre, ere she was surrounded by men
in boats, clamouring to get on board, all clad in their best
attire, displaying purses of money, and striving to pay their
court, and make selections.  <i>Parbleu!</i> the rape of the
Sabines was a joke to it!  They fought, bit, scratched, and
stabbed each other; several of their boats were overturned,
and thus many of their crews, instead of rushing into the
jaws of matrimony, found themselves in those of the blue
sharks that were gliding about in the waves below.
</p>

<p>
"From that day Guadaloupe became rent by jealousies,
intrigues, and contentions; and thus white men were chained,
and scourged, or imprisoned, and slain by their fellows on
the merest pretences; and all this came to pass through the
loves and lovers of Madame Fayolle and the demoiselles she
had brought hither from the Faubourgs of Paris to seek
their fortunes; but I shall have the honour of telling more
about all this another time, as I possess the authentic
records, which were prepared by my ancestor, M. de Thoisy,
for the special perusal of his most Christian Majesty&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"If you could afford me some information about the
movements of our troops," said I, wearily, "I would be much
more grateful to you, monsieur."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Bon!</i>  Monsieur le Capitaine.  After falling back from
Point à Petre, where Citoyen Victor Hugues&mdash;<i>sacre!</i>&mdash;had
his Republican mustachoes singed pretty well, M. le General
Grey has occupied, with his whole forces, all the ground
between Point St. Jean and the Bay of Mahault, having erected
many batteries of mortars and 24-pounders, thus giving
perfect security to Basse Terre, while Admiral Jervis has blocked
up the harbour by his ships.  There is a species of truce
just now, so all is quiet; but perfect peace shall never be
established either here or in Europe until his Most Christian
Majesty Louis XVII.&mdash;the poor boy in the Temple&mdash;is
placed on the throne of his father.  <i>Ah! mon Dieu! mon
Dieu!</i> we live in strange times.  Do you know, M. le
Capitaine, that I can remember&mdash;but <i>mille pardons</i>&mdash;I weary
you&mdash;another day we shall talk of these things; meantime,
adieu."
</p>

<p>
But this prosaical old gentleman did not leave until he had
detailed the only affair which interested me in his
conversation&mdash;the defence of Fort Matilda by our troops, which I
may briefly mention, as I heard it from others, rather than
from him.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant Colonel Colin Grahame, of the Fusiliers, was
appointed to command the troops in Basse Terre, and to him
fell the task of defending the camp at Seville, where he was
forced to surrender on the 6th of October, his force having
been reduced to one hundred and twenty-five officers and
men!
</p>

<p>
Three companies of ours were now engaged in the
desperate defence of Fort Matilda, under Lieutenant-General
Prescott, a stern soldier of the old school, who was wont to
sit on the ramparts, smoking a "yard of clay," with all the
gravity of a pasha in his harem, or a sachem with the great
pipe of peace, while shot whistled and shells exploded about
his ears.

<h3>
CHAPTER LXVIII.
<br><br>
A DISCOVERY.
</h3>

<p>
Ere long, I was advanced from cooling drinks and chicken-broth
to the dignity of turtle-soup (as it can only be made
in the Antilles), dashed with lime-juice, and a long glass of
Madeira after.  Then I became quite convalescent, and after
a careful toilet was one day led by M. de Thoisy to the
drawing-room, to be introduced, with great formality, to his
family circle.  I was first presented to Madame, a little and
somewhat shrivelled old lady, of rather aristocratic aspect,
with hair almost white as snow.  She bowed very low
thrice, with an old-fashioned courtesy, and patted my cheek
kindly while thanking me in very good terms as her
husband's preserver; and now, as good Madame de Thoisy bears
no more important part in my story, and was chiefly famous
for the conserving of limes, citrons, guava, and so forth, we
shall refer to her no more in these pages.
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur," continued De Thoisy, introducing me to
three very handsome young girls in succession, "my
daughters&mdash;Georgette, Claire, and Julie&mdash;and now I hope you all
know each other."
</p>

<p>
Claire and Julie were both blondes, with complexions
miraculously fair, considering their French blood; but in
Georgette, the tallest, most fully rounded&mdash;in short, the most
beautiful, as she seemed to please and fill the eye, I
recognized the black orbs, the long lashes, and the bright golden
hair of my supposed dream, for this fair French girl in her
eyes and tresses had that remarkable contrast which we so
seldom find, and which becomes so dazzling, when brilliant.
</p>

<p>
These three sisters were all accomplished; they played
and sang well, and were, I afterwards discovered, fall of
vivacity and drollery, which made them very charming
friends.
</p>

<p>
"They have all been dying with curiosity&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Pardon, papa, say gratitude," urged Georgette.
</p>

<p>
"Well, with gratitude, M. le Capitaine," continued M. de
Thoisy, "to see one to whom we owe so much; for, <i>parbleu!</i> if
they set some value on my life, be assured that I set a
great deal more."
</p>

<p>
"Dear, dear papa," said little Claire, "do not talk of it;
ah! how terrified he must have been&mdash;now, was he not,
M. le Capitaine?"
</p>

<p>
"Terrified!" reiterated De Thoisy, ere I could reply to the
pretty questioner; "<i>mon Dieu!</i> I should think so!  Though
there never was a De Thoisy, either in France or the
Antilles, who feared death, there <i>are</i> ways of dying
pleasantly; but to be fricasseed alive, joint by joint, under the
jaws of the Congo fetish, is not one."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! monsieur," said Julie, "how much we owe you for
saving our dear papa!"
</p>

<p>
"But, with a single company of white soldiers, was it
prudent of you to attack a thousand savages?" asked
Georgette.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Merci</i>," exclaimed De Thoisy; "my Georgette is becoming
quite a little general!"
</p>

<p>
"It was not prudent, perhaps, mademoiselle," said I: "but
I had Lord Kildonan's orders to obey, in the first place; and,
in the second, there are times, such as that night in the pass
of the Dos d'Ane, when the best prudence is rashness or
courage."
</p>

<p>
"Bon!  M. Comte de Provence, brother of his most
Christian Majesty Louis XVI., could not have spoken better
than M. le Capitaine," said her father.  "Then you forget,
Georgette, that the soldiers monsieur commanded were <i>Les
Fusiliers Royals Ecossais</i>, and in old France we have a
proverb which says <i>Fier comme un brave Ecossais!</i> for there
was a time when, like the valiant and faithful Irish, the
countrymen of M. le Capitaine, were the best bulwarks of
the French throne, and of the children of St. Louis."
</p>

<p>
M. de Thoisy raised his hat as he spoke&mdash;he always did so
when speaking of the royal line of France; for, like the
true-hearted adherents of the Stuarts, this old gentleman
clung to the Bourbons in their exile&mdash;the withered branch
of a fallen tree; and under the protection of <i>our</i> outposts,
had placed on his hat the fatal <i>cocarde blanche</i>, which had
subjected so many to the platoon, the gallows, and the
guillotine.
</p>

<p>
Our mutual introductions over, inquiries about the state
of my wounded arm followed; it was, of course, still in a
sling, made for me, it appeared, by Georgette; and then
ensued one of those little pauses which often occur, before
people become thoroughly acquainted.  Suddenly Georgette
said:
</p>

<p>
"Mamma, you quite forget that we have residing with us,
a lady who is a countrywoman of Monsieur le Capitaine.
He must know her husband, who commands the batteries at
Bay Mahault, and I am sure they will be enchanted to
meet.  Ah&mdash;here she comes!" she added gaily, as a young
lady without a bonnet, but with a long-fringed green
parasol, entered the drawing-room from a species of
conservatory which opened off it, only that its walls were all
Venetian blinds and not glass, which would have been
intolerable in such a climate.
</p>

<p>
"Madame," said M. de Thoisy, hastening forward, "permit
me to introduce the young officer of whom you have
heard so much&mdash;he who saved my life and&mdash;ah, <i>mon
Dieu!</i> what is the matter&mdash;what have I done?"
</p>

<p>
The old French planter, who had been bowing as if he
meant to jerk his wig off, might well exclaim thus, on
hearing the interjection of mingled surprise and joy which
escaped me, for the lady who approached was no other than
Amy Lee!
</p>

<p>
Amy Lee, here in Guadaloupe, looking more radiant and
more beautiful than I had ever imagined her, with jetty
black hair exquisitely smoothed, a white muslin dress that
waved in gauzy folds around her, and a shawl of some
equally light material, but of broad black and golden stripes,
floating over her fair plump shoulders.  Her dark eyes
sparkled merrily, but now it seemed as if Amy had a more
finished, a more fashionable, and decidedly a more confident
air, than the girl I used to love and flirt with at Applewood.
</p>

<p>
She bowed politely, as, with an inimitable bearing of her
proud head and ample skirt, she swept up to the sofa, and
seated herself beside Madame de Thoisy, saying to me:
</p>

<p>
"I am so happy to find, sir, that you are so far recovered
as to be able to leave your room.  No doubt you will soon
join the regiment?"
</p>

<p>
"Amy!" I exclaimed in a breathless voice.
</p>

<p>
"Sir&mdash;I beg pardon&mdash;did you speak?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"My name <i>is</i> Amy," she said, with a well-bred smile of
perplexity, looking me full in the face through her clear
eyes.
</p>

<p>
She evidently did not recognize me in my uniform; for
all I had seen and undergone of late had changed me very
much in figure, bearing, and expression.
</p>

<p>
"Do you not know me?" I asked almost imploringly, and
she replied:
</p>

<p>
"Not personally, sir; but I have the pleasure of knowing
that you are an officer in my husband's regiment, and one
whom he esteems most highly."
</p>

<p>
"Your husband's regiment!" I reiterated in bewilderment,
and quite oblivious of the presence of our host and
his family, to whom all this was an enigma.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;but you were absent when I joined him from
England.  He is now in command of the batteries at Bay
Mahault, and always calls you his favourite comrade."
</p>

<p>
"I am much obliged to him," said I coldly, and then
added impetuously, "But who the deuce is your husband?"
</p>

<p>
"The Earl of Kildonan, senior Lieutenant-Colonel of the
Scots Fusiliers," replied Amy drily; "and you, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"I am Oliver Ellis&mdash;don't you remember me, Amy?
Oh, you cannot have forgotten Oliver, whom you were
wont to love, and who loved you so much, at dear old
Applewood."
</p>

<p>
"What! are you my old friend&mdash;my lover Oliver?" she
exclaimed, with a gleam of pleasure in her charming eyes,
and a burst of merry laughter&mdash;so merry that it served,
even more than her marriage, to demolish a very romantic
structure which I had been raising mentally.  "I am
thunderstruck, but oh, most happy to see you&mdash;to meet you
again!  We were such dear good friends&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Friends&mdash;rather; come, this is very good!" said I
under my breath and with indescribable annoyance.
</p>

<p>
"You must tell me all about this, and how it came to
pass.  Come, sit here between Georgette and me, and tell us
all about yourself directly," she added, taking my left hand
in hers; the wounded right was too tender yet to brook
being meddled with.  I felt confused and piqued, for
although we had heard in the regiment that the earl had
married a Miss Lee in Scotland, and that his countess, after
joining him in Guadaloupe, had been nearly taken by the
French at the recapture of La Fleur d'Epée, I would as
readily have conceived that his wife might prove to be
queen of Sheba as my old love Amy Lee, of Applewood.
</p>

<p>
So there was a great destruction of a little romance in a
moment.
</p>

<p>
I had no reason to find any fault with Amy; and yet it
seemed as if a sudden pique at her made Georgette's gentle
eyes more dark, and her golden hair more bright than ever.
</p>

<p>
I took my seat between them.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap69"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER LXIX.
<br><br>
GEORGETTE.
</h3>

<p>
A few weeks rolled delightfully away at the Villa de
Thoisy, which my host informed me was an exact copy&mdash;so
far as West-Indian requirements would permit&mdash;of his
ancient ancestral mansion at the town of Thoisy, where, as
he added, "one of the most Christian kings had kept
one of his mistresses," on the small river Chalaronne, in old
France.  I rapidly became so well, that serious thoughts of
rejoining the regiment at Bay Mahault occurred to me, but
Lord Kildonan in a letter to the countess, which was
brought by Tom Telfer, mentioned that I need not hurry
myself, as all was quiet on the side of the island which was
occupied by Victor Hugues and his particoloured forces.
</p>

<p>
Occasionally Haystone, Bruce, and others of ours, rode
over to see me, and spend an evening with the de Thoisy
girls; then we had always music and dancing, and, despite
the heat of the weather, we red-coats flew about like fireflies
in the waltz.
</p>

<p>
And how shall I describe the languor and charm of a
<i>tête-à-tête</i>&mdash;flirtation, if you will&mdash;in a night in Guadaloupe,
when windows, doors, and green jealousies are all thrown
open, to admit the aromatic breeze that comes over
savannahs of spices and sugar-canes, through forests laden with
golden fruit, from the moonlit sea that rippled before the
trade wind; or when seated in a bower the green leaves
and brilliant flowers of which are visible as at noonday in
the radiance of the queen of night, as she careered through
the deep blue of a tropical sky; or when wandering in the
avenues of fan-palms, with no light but the flaming summit
of La Soufrière, or the stars that were reflected in the
waters of the Rivière Sallee.
</p>

<p>
An undefinable sentiment of pique at Amy Lee determined
me on falling in love with some one else.  Of course,
in this mood I soon did so; and Amy's presence, instead of
being a bar, spurred me on: thus, ere many days were past,
I was in love with Georgette.
</p>

<p>
I have said that she was beautiful; but, of course, every
lover deems the object of his admiration to be so&mdash;or at
least to exhibit perfection in some point.  When her soft
dark eyes met mine, I felt as if our very souls became
incorporated, so deep and winning was their expression; and
when she spoke, every pulse seemed to beat responsive to
her own.  To be constantly with such a girl, and <i>not</i> fall in
love with her, was impossible.  We drove, rode, talked,
danced, and sketched together.  As some one says,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  She sketch'd; the vale, the wood, the beach,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grew lovelier from her pencil's shading.<br>
  She botanised; I envied each<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young blossom in her boudoir fading.<br>
  She warbled Handel; it was grand&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She might make Catalani jealous.<br>
  She touch'd the organ,&mdash;I could stand<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For hours and hours to blow the bellows.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Yet I was always so timid in Georgette's presence, that
I envied the cool impudence with which Haystone made
love (without meaning it), in true garrison fashion, either to
Claire or Julie, which of them mattered not a straw to him;
for example, when leaning over the latter at the piano, I
overheard a conversation in this style:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You have a charming bracelet, Mademoiselle Julie."
</p>

<p>
"Papa's gift on my last birthday.  Are not the pearls
magnificent?"
</p>

<p>
"On <i>another</i> arm than yours, Julie, they would be
dazzling."
</p>

<p>
"On another arm?&mdash;monsieur, I do not understand."
</p>

<p>
"Are you so artless as not to perceive that the whiteness
of your arm darkens even these snowy pearls?" whispered
Haystone, impressively.
</p>

<p>
Poor Julie sighed, and played the deuce with her music,
for Rowland Haystone was a handsome rogue, and pleased
her eye.
</p>

<p>
On another occasion I heard Claire say to him,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"It is no use saying that you love me, monsieur, for I
don't believe in you; we quite understood each other."
</p>

<p>
"To know you, dear Claire, and not love you, would
be&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What&mdash;something very tremendous, no doubt?"
</p>

<p>
"A reproach to any man."
</p>

<p>
"Of course!" said she, drooping her eyelashes to hide a
twinkle of drollery.
</p>

<p>
"But less so, however, to one of the Twenty-First."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, wherefore?"
</p>

<p>
"Because we are the most inflammable corps in the service."
</p>

<p>
Claire burst into a fit of laughter, for this "Chatham
style" of love-making, in which there is always a dash of
impertinence, amused her exceedingly, but I was not sorry
when Haystone, with his company, was despatched by the Earl,
on a "nigger-hunt," into the great savannah of Basse Terre,
for by him and others of the corps, I was frequently rallied
on what they termed "my fancy for a French girl."  The
countess, who perceived me to be annoyed one day, by some
of my comrades' banter which she had overheard, handed a
volume of Zimmerman, with a significant smile, as we
promenaded together in the verandah: the name of Georgette
was written on a leaf, which Amy had marked with pencil,
and the paragraph she indicated ran thus; and as nobody
reads Zimmerman now, I may as well give it at full
length:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Of what value are all the babblings and vain boastings
of society, when compared to that domestic felicity which
we experience in the company and conversation of an
amiable woman, whose charms awaken the dormant faculties
of the soul, and fill the mind with finer energies; whose
smiles prompt our enterprises, and whose assistance ensures
success; who inspires us with congenial greatness and
sublimity; who with judicious penetration, weighs and examines
our thoughts, our actions, our whole character; who
observes all our foibles, warns us with sincerity of their
consequences, and reforms us with gentleness and affection;
who by a tender communication of her thoughts and
observations conveys new instruction to our minds, and, by
pouring the warm and generous feelings of her heart into
our bosoms, animates us incessantly to the exercise of every
virtue, and completes the polished perfection of our character
by the soft allurements of love and delightful concord of her
sentiments.  In such an intercourse, all that is noble and
virtuous in human nature is preserved within the breast,
and every evil propensity dies away!"
</p>

<p>
"It is true&mdash;very true," said I.
</p>

<p>
"What is true, monsieur?" asked Georgette, whom the
countess (for so I must name Amy Lee now) had artfully
contrived to place next me, while she herself disappeared.
</p>

<p>
"A passage I was reading in your Zimmerman,
mademoiselle," said I, colouring with confusion.
</p>

<p>
"Show it to me?"
</p>

<p>
She read it, and as she did so, the rich bloom deepened
on her cheek, and she closed the volume with a timid smile,
saying artlessly&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"But where is all this perfection to be found?"
</p>

<p>
"In you, mademoiselle&mdash;in you, Georgette," said I, in a
scarcely audible voice.
</p>

<p>
"What&mdash;are you about to make love to me?"
</p>

<p>
"If I may be permitted, dear Georgette!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but you have been in love <i>before</i>?" said she, with a
smile of drollery; "now say, have you not, for I know
better."
</p>

<p>
"Georgette, people often have little fancies."
</p>

<p>
"And you have one for me&mdash;<i>très bon</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"Georgette!"
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur hangs his head with a very pleading air; you
were in love, but you joined the army; alas! you see that
ambition outlives love."
</p>

<p>
"Georgette&mdash;you are quite a philosopher!" said I,
recovering, and taking up her tone, which was somewhat
bantering, as if unwilling to believe me; but I could
perceive that her poor little hands trembled very much as she
plucked the lemon-water flowers, and her colour came and
went with every pulsation.
</p>

<p>
"Georgette&mdash;dearest Georgette," I urged.
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur?"
</p>

<p>
"I was about to say something&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What?"
</p>

<p>
"That I tenderly love you."
</p>

<p>
"Love me!" she reiterated in a whisper; "ah, do not
say so&mdash;at least so earnestly.
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I know not&mdash;it is no use loving me, monsieur; but
we see so much of each other&mdash;that&mdash;and is it not a strange
chance which throws us so frequently together?"
</p>

<p>
"Do not term it chance, Georgette."
</p>

<p>
"What then?" she asked, with a smile, as she regained
courage.
</p>

<p>
"Now, monsieur, what <i>do</i> you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Destiny</i>&mdash;believe it is destiny, dear, dear Georgette?"
said I, clasping her waist with my hands.
</p>

<p>
Poor Georgette trembled more, blushed deeper, and then
grew very pale, but did not repel me.
</p>

<p>
From the verandah we strolled into the gardens, where
more than an hour glided imperceptibly over us.  What we
said, or left unsaid, would occupy a good many pages; but
being of no interest to any one but ourselves, need not be
rehearsed here; yet, ere we returned to the villa, to hear
old M. George de Thoisy's everlasting recollections of bygone
times&mdash;to taste and praise Madame's preserves; to resume
our evening music and gaiety with Claire, Julie, Bruce, and
Rowland Haystone&mdash;Georgette and I had exchanged our
rings, and sealed our troth with gifts dearer, but less tangible
than gold.
</p>

<p>
But the next and most formidable move in the matter
was to open the trenches to M. de Thoisy, a man full of old
French prejudices, and who, with all his aristocratic
predilections, had other, and perhaps more commercial views for
his three beautiful daughters than portioning them off to
the penniless captains and subs of the Scots Fusiliers.

<h3>
CHAPTER LXX.
<br><br>
A CRISIS.
</h3>

<p>
Some days after this, Georgette and I were in the recess
of a window of the drawing-room, ostensibly to watch the
sunbeams casting their broad flakes of hazy light athwart
the wooded hills, and on the slopes that lay between them
and the sea.  We were hand in hand, but silent and full of
our own thoughts, which a gentle pressure from time to
time alone indicated.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Georgette," said I; "I envy your peaceful
seclusion here."
</p>

<p>
"You envy us!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"You, a soldier&mdash;one who has led a life of bustle and
excitement, and who, by the account of his friends, has
been a veritable Wandering Jew?"
</p>

<p>
"Nevertheless, 'tis true; I envy this rural solitude;
here we are quite lost in a forest of flowers, aloes, and
palms."
</p>

<p>
"How romantic we are becoming!" said she merrily;
"but when our tastes are so different, monsieur&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, do not say so!"
</p>

<p>
"Even our races, and our creeds," she added, sighing;
"so be pleased to say how or why?"
</p>

<p>
"Well; in your heart there seems to be filled here all
the domestic void I feel in my own&mdash;a circle of near and
dear relations.  You have a father to consult and to
embrace.  Mine is in his grave, and I scarcely ever knew him.
You have a mother, who, whenever she kisses you, makes
me think of mine whom I left in her old age; you have
two sisters, each beautiful as yourself, Georgette, who, each
time that I behold them near you, make me think of my
poor little Lotty in Scotland, far away."
</p>

<p>
"Ecosse!  I have heard papa talk of that country; the
sun never shines in England; and an old Abbé once assured
me that the moon is only seen sometimes in Scotland; now
tell me, M. l'Ecossais, is that true?"
</p>

<p>
"One day you shall see for yourself."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Oliver," said she, almost weeping; "papa will
never consent to your loving me."
</p>

<p>
"Do not say so, Georgette; for though I have my own
fears on the subject, your misgivings make me wretched."
</p>

<p>
"Come, we must not be cast down," said she, with sudden
gaiety, for she was full of impulses; and shaking back her
rich golden hair, while her beautiful dark eyes sparkled with
love and light, she opened the piano, and ran her rapid little
fingers over the ivory keys.
</p>

<p>
"I shall sing to you."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, Georgette."
</p>

<p>
"But what shall it be?"
</p>

<p>
"Whatever you please."
</p>

<p>
"Well then,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Ah, ça ira, ça ira, ça ira!<br>
  Les aristocrats à la lanterns!"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Georgette!"
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter?"
</p>

<p>
"Can you profane your dear lips by a song so horrible?"
</p>

<p>
"So republican, you would say.  Ah, <i>mon Dieu</i>," said she,
shrugging her white shoulders, "I only meant to be droll,
and you actually scold me already.  Well&mdash;is this better?"
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Halte là! halte là!<br>
  La Garde Royale est là!<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
And she waggishly sang a verse of this song, which was
wont to be a favourite with the Chevalier Dutriel.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis a camp ditty, and if mamma hears me, she will not
be pleased.  Ah," she added, turning over her music, "here
is something you will like better:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
  Adieu, charmant pays de France!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Que je dois tant chérir,<br>
  Berceau de mon heureuse enfance,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adieu, te quitter c'est mourir!"<br>
</p>

<p>
and so on, she sang with exquisite sweetness the <i>Adieux de
Marie Stuart</i>.  We were, I thought, alone; my arm was
around her, and turning her dear little face to mine, I kissed
her tenderly.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Morbleu!</i>" said an angry voice close by.
</p>

<p>
I turned, and saw her father surveying us sternly, as he
appeared with unpleasant suddenness at one of the
drawing-room windows, which unfolded to the tiled floor of the
verandah.  Striking his gold-headed cane with great irritation
on the tiles, with his wig and old-fashioned coat, he
bore the closest resemblance to the angry Father of the
old comedy that ever I beheld.
</p>

<p>
"Retire, mademoiselle," said he; "and as for <i>you</i>, M. le
Capitaine, you will be pleased&mdash;<i>sacre!</i>&mdash;to follow me to the
library."
</p>

<p>
Georgette retired&mdash;she almost fled, while I followed Père
de Thoisy into his library, which was decorated in a very
florid style, after that of his late Most Christian Majesty's
"snuggery" in the Louvre.  Coldly, but politely, the old
gentleman at once brought me "to book" on the subject of
my intentions.
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur," said he, "I owe you much&mdash;my family owe
you much; but you must pardon me demanding on what
terms you are with my eldest daughter?"
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur de Thoisy," I began, not knowing what the
deuce to say; "I beseech you to consider&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"To the point at once," said he drily, "to the point,
M. le Capitaine, as a man of honour, for such I deem you.",
</p>

<p>
"M. de Thoisy, I love her."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Parbleu</i>!  I dreaded some such <i>dénoûment</i> as this! but
is it honest&mdash;is it a fair return for my hospitality&mdash;my
unceasing kindness to you?"
</p>

<p>
"We cannot control our hearts, my dear sir."
</p>

<p>
"But we may control our passions!" said he impetuously;
"and I believe there is no heart in the matter."
</p>

<p>
"Alas! sir, do not talk thus; what heart could have
escaped here?  If I had not fallen in love with Georgette, I
must have done so with Julie&mdash;if not with Julie, with Claire;
for three girls more winning and charming&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Sacre</i>!  I can understand all that; but tell me, does
Georgette love you in return?"
</p>

<p>
"I rejoice in the hope&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Only the hope?"
</p>

<p>
"In the promise&mdash;the avowal that she does love me."
</p>

<p>
"Georgette will be rich, M. le Capitaine; I can give each
of my girls a portion fit for any demoiselle at the Court
of the Most Christian King (the hat was raised at these
words), while you, monsieur, have only your epaulettes and
your sword."
</p>

<p>
"My epaulettes I won at the risk of my life in the
struggle we have commenced to save French Royalists from
French Republicans; what other mission brought us here?
My sword, M. de Thoisy, saved you from a dreadful death,
when all your francs and livres would have failed to do so."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Parbleu!</i> you are right&mdash;pardon me," said the old
French gentleman, who did not lack generosity.
</p>

<p>
"Georgette's wealth would be quite enough for two; but
I shall make over to her, or to you," said I, by a happy
thought, and with an air of splendid generosity, "a ship
that I possess."
</p>

<p>
"A ship?"
</p>

<p>
"A ship containing thirty millions of pieces of eight."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Mon Dieu</i>!  M. le Capitaine, are you in your senses?"
exclaimed De Thoisy, holding up his hands.
</p>

<p>
"Quite," said I, while M. de Thoisy elevated his shoulders
to his ears, and his eyebrows to the roots of his periwig.
</p>

<p>
"Where is this ship&mdash;what is this you tell me?&mdash;what is
her name?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>La Lima</i>."
</p>

<p>
"That sounds Spanish."
</p>

<p>
"She was Spanish."
</p>

<p>
"Thirty millions of pieces of eight!"
</p>

<p>
"I give you my word of honour that I can put you in
possession of such a ship, as her existence is known to me
alone."
</p>

<p>
"Is it credible&mdash;<i>mille tonnerres!</i>&mdash;can it be?"
</p>

<p>
"You believe me?"
</p>

<p>
The old French gentleman laid his hand upon his breast,
and replied by a profound bow.
</p>

<p>
"But will monsieur be so good as explain?"
</p>

<p>
I then related my history of the sunken galleon in the
Isle of Tortoises, and he heard with growing wonder my detail
of her exact position in the cavern, and the treasure she
contained.
</p>

<p>
"Thirty millions of pieces of eight&mdash;ah!  Marie, Mère de
Dieu!  One must boil a good many acres of sugar-cane to
realize such a sum as that!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, take her, monsieur, and all she contains&mdash;but give
me your daughter."
</p>

<p>
"M. le Capitaine&mdash;Georgette is yours."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER LXXI.
<br><br>
CONCLUSION.
</h3>

<p>
Six months after the interview related here, I found
myself on the brow of an eminence which overlooks the little
wooded dell wherein lies the village in which the first chapter
of this story opens, and where my mother's little cottage
stands.
</p>

<p>
The month was October, and the russet hues of autumn,
lent a sombre aspect to the evening landscape.  The village
and the scene were all unchanged as when I saw them
before; and it was difficult for me to realize the events and
years that had passed since last I stood there.  But I had
still on the uniform of a Scots Fusilier; Rowland Haystone
was by my side, and I had left Georgette fatigued with her
journey and our long voyage home in the <i>Adder</i>, at an hotel
in town, while accompanied by my friend and comrade, I
proceeded on foot to the residence of my mother.
</p>

<p>
The red crisped leaves whirled on the evening wind;
a ruddy gleam played on the windows of the wayside houses
from the coal fires within and a warm glow glared across
the road from the smith's forge, where we heard the clang of
a hammer on the resounding anvil.
</p>

<p>
The purple radiance of the set sun yet lingered on the
heath-clad summits of the distant hills, whose long and wavy
line spread far away to the westward; and every feature in
the landscape, and every sound that fell on the ear, spoke to
me of <i>home</i>, and filled my heart with a strange combination
of joy and sadness.
</p>

<p>
Since those days, a railway has effected a great change in
our little village.  <i>Now</i>, an excursion train shoots ten
thousand passengers through it at the rate of forty miles per
hour.  <i>Then</i>, its visitors were few.  The war-worn soldier,
travelling afoot with his knapsack, and with his memories of
Granby, Cornwallis, and Abercrombie; the Heights of
Abraham, and the Bay of Aboukir; the old familiar pedlar
with his pack of trinkets and his blarney; the swarthy and
uncouth gipsies, who made horn spoons and milking-pails;
or the weary wayfarer with his proverbial staff and bundle,
came there at times, leisurely, slowly, and surely; pausing
on the brow of the hill, ere they descended into the
densely-wooded valley, where the red mountain burn brawled
hoarsely under an old bridge of the monkish times, or halted
to drink a stoup of brown ale, or of limpid usquebaugh, at
the old village inn, ere they pushed further on their journey
into the busier world beyond.
</p>

<p>
Now, a giant viaduct, that might remind one of Rome or
of Tivoli, save that its numerous arches are built of flaming
red brick, spans, high in air, the wooded dell, leaping, as it
were, from hill to hill; and then the huge train clatters and
screams with its flaring red lights and brass-mounted engine,
as it tears along with its living freight, or with countless
trucks of luggage,&mdash;on, on, and on, as with a roar like
thunder, it vanishes into the bowels of a tunnelled mountain.
In those days, a newspaper which came once weekly, to the
minister, served to inform the whole village of the doings of
"the Corsican tyrant;" of the battle of Camperdown, and
the glories of Trafalgar; but <i>now</i>, we heard how the Guards
and Highlanders went up the heights of Alma, and of the
valour of "the thin red streak" at Balaclava, as soon as the
citizens of the great metropolis,&mdash;for we have our own
electric wire as well as they.
</p>

<p>
Strange as it may seem in these our days of cheap
postage and swift communication, in consequence of the
wandering life I had led, and the desultory nature of our
operations by land and sea in the Antilles, I had never
heard from my home since leaving it, nor had any letters of
mine been received; and thus, with a heart swollen by
anxiety and mournful recollections, I made a rapid survey
of the scene, dreading&mdash;I knew not what!
</p>

<p>
An aged thorn-tree that had overhung the road for
centuries, and whereon many an outlaw had swung in the
times of old&mdash;a tree whose gnarled branches I was wont to
climb, had been cut down, and its <i>absence</i> gave me a shock,
so sensitive did vague apprehension make me.  The roads
and paths were all familiar as the faces of old friends; in
boyhood I had traversed them a thousand times, seeking
bird-nests, rabbit-holes, and scarlet berries in autumn.
</p>

<p>
The old manse recalled Dr. Twaddel the minister, with
his white hair, his curved paunch, and his old bunch of red
gold seals that hung thereat&mdash;and my poor mother's visit to
him about <i>me</i>.  How sadly I smiled when thinking of his
monitory tones!&mdash;and there too, was the ancient church
with its ivy-shrouded belfry, wherein an owl nestled by
day and screamed by night.  The old village signboards,
and the old village sounds were around me; and now I was
at the gate of the garden, in which Lotty and I used to
plant flowers and shrubs&mdash;shrubs that had since grown to
veritable trees; and <i>now</i> after all my wanderings, after
ploughing the great deep, and having had the roar of battle
in my ear, and seen the colours of the Fusiliers riven to
rags by shot and shell, I felt like a boy again when standing
on my mother's threshold.
</p>

<p>
I was close to the first starting-place of the soul, yet my
heart sank within me!
</p>

<p>
I was so full of anxious thoughts, that Haystone (rightly
dreading lest strangers instead of friends might meet me)
hastily rang the bell, and after speaking to a servant,
returned, saying cheerily&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"All right, my boy&mdash;the old lady is alive and well."
</p>

<p>
"Thank God!" said I, as we were ushered in.
</p>

<p>
I stood once more within the little parlour (how very
small it seemed?), on the walls of which the engravings of
Wolfe and Cornwallis were yet hanging with my father's
sword and gilded gorget&mdash;and my mother was before me,
paler, thinner, and it might be more bent with years than
when I saw her last.  Her little work-basket, and a book or
two, with her spectacles, were by her side, and a great sleek
tom-cat was dozing on the hearthrug, in the warm glow of
the fire.
</p>

<p>
On the entrance of two officers in uniform, the old lady
rose with surprise and some alarm; it was evident that her
seclusion was seldom broken.
</p>

<p>
A chair stood opposite, and seemed to say that Lotty had
just left it,&mdash;to adjust her hair, or do something about her
toilet, no doubt.  I was trembling with emotion, and
Haystone, who dearly loved a scene, and feared I might
frustrate the effect he intended to produce, now said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You must pardon us, madam; but we are two officers
of the Scots Fusiliers, who were passing through the village,
and hearing that you resided here, have called to pay our
respects to the widow of one whose memory is still cherished
in our regiment."
</p>

<p>
"For his sake, gentlemen, you are doubly welcome,"
replied my mother tremulously, as a film overspread her
spectacles, and her heart warmed to the red-coats; "I was
with the army in America; my husband marched with his
regiment to fight the enemy on the banks of the Hudson;
the firing was heavy all that dreadful day; and ere the
sunset, I&mdash;I was a widow, and my children were fatherless!
It was the will of God, and the chance of war."
</p>

<p>
"Your children," I stammered; "had you more than
Lo&mdash;than Miss Ellis?"
</p>

<p>
"Sir, I had a son, who, had he been spared to me&mdash;&mdash;" she
paused, for her emotion became as deep as my own;&mdash;"Through
the long hours of many a weary night I have
watched, and wept, and prayed for him.  Long his place
seemed vacant, his chair and plate unoccupied; and when
I carved for his sister, at our frugal little meals, a bitterness
came over me, and I sighed, for there was no <i>other</i> to help;
but I am used to it now."
</p>

<p>
"He must have been a sad dog, this son of yours,
madam," said Haystone, pinching my arm.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, sir! do not say so.  He went out on a dreadful
night&mdash;the night of a political riot, when the troops fired on
the friends of the people, and when many men were slain;
he disappeared and no trace of him could ever be discovered.
Shall I tell you how hours and days, weeks and years rolled
on, ere my sorrow became placid?  But my first-born&mdash;my
little boy was too dear, though lost, to be forgotten! his
face, his eyes and voice, with a thousand little memories
of him, were ever before me.  People called him wild and
wayward; but to me he was ever gentle and mild as the
tender lamb, to which the blessed God tempers the wind of
Heaven.  But I weary you, gentlemen, by all this; I forget
you cannot listen to it as my dear daughter Lotty does.
While the young dream of the future, the old can only
dream of the <i>past</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Madam," said Haystone, "such regrets as yours are
most natural."
</p>

<p>
"I had two sons, it would seem," said my mother
thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"Two?" I reiterated, fearing that her mind wandered.
</p>

<p>
"It seemed so to me, one, a dear little boy, whom I loved
in childhood, and who loved me well; and <i>another</i>, who
deserted me in manhood, for he who did so seemed so
different from the curly-haired, waxen-skinned and
bright-eyed little Oliver who slept in my bosom in infancy."
</p>

<p>
These words wrung my soul, and even Haystone seemed
to think we were going quite far enough; but the old lady
resumed.
</p>

<p>
"It has been a fearful&mdash;a terrible feeling this to me.
He was the star of my life; the hope of my existence; the
sharer of my humble crust; the joy and altar whereon were
garnered up the hope and soul of a poor old widowed
mother&mdash;but he left me!  If yet he lives, may God forgive
him&mdash;yea, as I do! ..... My dove went forth upon the
waters; but, alas! he returned to me no more.  The sunshine
has seemed darker since I lost him; but it may be that my
sight is dimmer; for as Ossian says, 'the years of age are
dark and unlovely.'"
</p>

<p>
I felt ready to sink, for while saying all this, she had
been gradually pushing the lamp nearer us across the
table, and gazing wistfully and nervously at my face, for
since I had spoken, <i>a mysterious chord</i> had been stirred in
her heart, and some fond memory of my features came
vaguely and strangely over her.
</p>

<p>
The tears ran down my face as she drew nearer.
</p>

<p>
At last suspicion became conviction.
</p>

<p>
"Mother!" I exclaimed.  We simultaneously uttered a
cry and she sank into my arms, while Lotty, now a tall
and handsome girl&mdash;handsome as Georgette herself&mdash;rushed
in to join us, and Rowland Haystone, of whose presence we
were long quite oblivious, certainly had the satisfaction of
producing all the dramatic effect he desired.
</p>

<p>
On this tableau, can I do better than drop the curtain,
when we were all so happy; and yet I have a word or two
to add to the reader who has kindly followed me thus far by
sea and land.
</p>

<p>
My mother was enchanted with Georgette, and so would
you have been had you known her, for she proves to me all
that the famous paragraph of Zimmerman expressed.  Wealth
flowed in upon us, for old M. de Thoisy, whom we left
behind in Guadaloupe for a little time, chartered a vessel and
raised the treasure of <i>La Lima</i>, which amply repaid the
speculation by realizing our most sanguine expectations;
and from that hour my old comrades of all ranks, drew on
me as if I had been the Bank of England, or a species of
regimental factor.
</p>

<p>
We had not been at home a week before I detected
Haystone in the act of rhyming off to poor Lotty some of
his usual love-speeches; on which I borrowed a leaf from
Père de Thoisy's book, and at once took him to task on the
subject; so the result was, that Lotty became Mrs. Rowland
Haystone in three months after.
</p>

<p>
By this time the French had recaptured the whole of
Guadaloupe, and heavily on my old comrades fell the
slaughter of that day.
</p>

<p>
They defended Fort Matilda, our last stronghold there,
till it was no longer tenable, so severely had it been injured
by the enemy's fire; thus the Earl of Kildonan and Colonel
Grahame resolved to abandon it on the night of the 10th
December.  One company, under Lieutenant Paterson and
<i>Ensign Drumbirrel</i>, occupied the ramparts on the right of
the great breach; Price, Colepepper, and Mackay, each at
the head of their companies, fought bravely as they lined
the bank of the Gallion river, when the whole garrison, with
its stores and cannon, embarked on board the fleet of
Admiral Jervis.  By this time, the <i>three</i> companies which
covered the retreat, were reduced to six sergeants and
ninety-two rank and file!
</p>

<p>
I loved my regiment well; to me it had been friends and
kindred&mdash;home, a happy but movable home.  We had
shed our blood together; slept on the same turf; under the
same tents; endured the same hardships, and shared the
same glories, dangers, and disasters; for a "regiment is a
permanent body, depending for its excellence on the general
fellowship of a permanent set of officers&mdash;on their general
relations with the non-commissioned officers and men under
their command&mdash;a high <i>esprit du corps</i>&mdash;and the preservation
of old associations and recollections connected with its
past history and achievements."
</p>

<p>
We were a band of brothers, for there is among soldiers a
deep fount of fraternity, of which the citizen knows nothing,
and in which he cannot share.  "My comrade&mdash;my brother
soldier&mdash;my old brother officer!"&mdash;these, indeed, are endearing
terms, and in the spirit they imbue we share our blanket
in the bivouac, our last biscuit or ration bone, our last shot,
and, too often, our last shilling, together!
</p>

<p>
Since the capture of Martinique and the loss of Guadaloupe,
long years have changed, and war and pestilence have
made sad havock in the ranks; death, distance, and time,
have dug deep and fast their lonely graves on many a far
and foreign shore&mdash;far from the land of the rock and the
heather; but "while the kindling of life in my bosom
remains," I shall remember with pride and joy the friends
that I made, the dangers that I dared, and the years that I
spent in the old regiment of Scots Fusiliers.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
